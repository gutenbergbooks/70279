<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was a dreary, wet October
day, and drawing towards the
twilight. The dull leaden-looking
sky, the wet slippery pavements,
the chilly, cross, uncomfortable
passengers, gave to even the brightest
and most cheerful streets of the great city a
very dismal look; and, as for the meaner
ones, with their rows of dreary little shops
and tumble-down houses, their reeking gutters
and dripping wayfarers, they were utterly
forlorn.</p>

<p>In one of the meanest of these forlorn
streets, in the back attic of one of these
tumble-down houses, a little girl sat looking
out at the window. It was not a pleasant
prospect in the brightest of weather, that
little crowded court, upon which everybody’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
back-door opened, and where everybody’s
rubbish was collected; but the child was not
looking at the court. Neither did she seem
to be looking at the sky, though the little pale
face was turned wistfully upward; she rather
seemed to be thinking intently upon something
which occupied all her mind, and shut
out for the moment the dreary court below,
the dismal sky above, and even the poor
little room around her.</p>

<p>A very poor little room it was, indeed,—its
only furniture being a ragged, ill-made bed,
a rickety stand, two broken chairs, and an
old painted chest, near which a rusty stovepipe
came up through the floor and passed
out again at the low roof. But all the room
was brightened somehow by a group of four
merry, rosy children, who sat upon this chest,
their little bare legs dangling, and their damp
garments steaming in the heat, laughing
and chattering together in a queer mixture
of German and English, which none but an
emigrant’s child could understand.</p>

<p>“Bert!” cried the elder of the two boys,
glancing towards the window; “what are
you looking for, Bert?—the moon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>The children all laughed at this sally, but
“Bert” paid no attention; seeing which, the
boy sprang down from the chest and, with a
vigorous pull at the flaxen curls, turned the
wistful face round towards him. “Bert!”
said he, “don’t you know, if we don’t pick
the rags soon, it’ll be quite dark, and then
Moses will be shut up, and we’ll get nothing
for <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das Brod</i> to-morrow? Wake up! wake
up!”</p>

<p>The girl made no answer, but, with a weary
sigh, picked up an old basket filled with wet
rubbish, and, turning the contents out upon
the floor, began, with her brother’s help, to
sort them carefully into separate little heaps;
for Bertha Weisser, my dear children, the
dreaming girl by the window, and the heroine
of my little story, was nothing more nor less
than a poor little German rag-picker.</p>

<p>Poor and little as she was, however, Bertha
had arrived at a dignity which few of my
young readers have reached, I hope; for Bertha
was the head of this little household,—the
one whom alone all the children were
bound to “mind,” and to whom also, alas!
they were bound to look for their daily bread;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
for Berty’s father had died at sea, and her
mother, not taking kindly to the foreign land,
had pined away soon afterward, leaving her
helpless family to get their own living as best
they could.</p>

<p>And the best way Bertha could think of—for
she was not very wise, being only eleven
years old—was, to gather the rags and papers,
the old bits of iron and copper, and
nails and other rubbish, from the gutters, and
sell them to Moses, an old Jew who lived
near her lodging; or else sometimes to sweep
the crossings with a stump of broom, looking
the while so forlorn and piteous that kind
passengers, when they were not in too great
haste, would fling her a penny.</p>

<p>This was a very poor way to get a living,
as you may suppose; and a very poor living
Berty would have gotten by it even if she
could have spent all her earnings upon herself,
which was by no means the case; for
there were Lina, and Gottlieb, and Rosa, and
little Fritz, the baby, all younger and therefore
more helpless than herself; and Berty
must care for them all; for had she not promised
her dead mother, and were they not her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
little family, the only ones this side the broad
ocean who had kindred blood of hers in their
veins?</p>

<p>To be sure, old Biddy Flanagan, to whom
the house belonged, let them have the back
attic, where their mother had died, rent-free,
because, as she said, it was but a poor place,
and she’d no heart to turn out “the motherless
orphants”; then, too, Gottlieb was growing
a sturdy lad, with very sharp eyes for old
nails and horse-shoes; and besides, the housepeople
often gave Fritz a penny when they
met him toddling about the passages; for
Fritz was a pretty baby,—bright-eyed and
rosy-cheeked, and sweet enough, in spite of
his rags, to open the hearts of people less
kind than Biddy Flanagan’s poor lodgers.
And beyond all this,—which Berty counted
great good-fortune,—an old lady in the next
street, who had known their mother in the
dear old Fatherland, sent them every week
a full meal of broken victuals. So Berty
thought this world a very kind world, though
her poor little heart was full, from morning
till night, with care for <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Kleinen</i>, as she
lovingly called the children in her pleasant
German tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>And Berty’s heart had been fuller than
usual these few weeks past; for, besides all
the care, it had held a great wish in it,—a
wish that filled it almost to bursting; and yet
this wish was such a very impossible one,
that Berty could think of but one way—and
that a very impossible way—of getting
it fulfilled:—“If but a fairy would come
along,—a fairy godmother such as Mrs.
Flanagan sometimes told them about, when
she was good-natured and not too busy,—and
offer Bert one of three wishes; O <em>then</em>!”
But New York was not “ould Ireland,” as
Biddy often assured them, and so, alas! the
fairy never came. Still the wish held its
place, and swelled the poor child’s heart all
the more, perhaps, that she never told it to
any one.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would lie awake far into
the night, staring with wide-open eyes at the
blank darkness of her attic, hugging little
Fritz in her arms, and thinking what if she
<em>had</em> a fairy godmother, and what if she <em>should</em>
come and bring the wish, until all the darkness
was full of glorious visions, and poor
little Berty, the German rag-picker, lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
there upon her bed of straw, in Biddy Flanagan’s
back attic, dreamed dreams as sweet
as any which visit the soft, guarded pillows
of you happy children who fall asleep with
father’s good-night blessings in your ears,
and mother’s good-night kisses on your lips.
Yes, the dear Heavenly Father, who bends so
lovingly from his Eternal Throne to listen to
your evening prayer, heard Berty’s German
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vaterunser</i> also, and watched over her, perhaps,
all the more tenderly because she had
no one else.</p><br>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was one night after they had
been to visit the kind old German
lady, their mother’s friend,
that this wonderful wish came
into Berty’s heart.</p>

<p>Madame Hansmann, as this old lady was
called by the people of Biddy’s house, was
not yet weaned from the dear <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vaterland</i>, as
she called her native country, and liked nothing
so well as talking of its kindly ways and
pleasant customs to any one who would listen.
She knew no English; but the homely
German, which, I dare say, sounds harsh and
unpleasant enough to you, was music in Bertha’s
ears; for it was the language in which
she had always heard her mother speak.
Berty had, too, or fancied she had, a dim
remembrance of some of the scenes which
the good old lady described, especially of
the Christmas trees, and birthday feasts, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the concerts in the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volksgarten</i>, or public
park, of the city where her parents had
lived.</p>

<p>It was, as I said, one night after a visit to
old Madame Hansmann that Berty’s wish
came into her heart. She was sitting in her
attic, striving patiently, by the light of a candle-end
which Biddy had given her, to fashion
a frock for little Fritz from an old one of
her own. She was not a very skilful seamstress,
and her materials were none of the
best; so, as you may imagine, she was much
too busy at first to pay much attention to
the children’s chatter, as they frolicked and
tumbled upon the old straw bed in the corner.
Presently, however, having planned out
her work to her mind, her attention was
attracted by their talk.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it nice,” said Lina, “what she
told about the Christmas trees? And Berty’s
seen one; but we never did.”</p>

<p>“Poh!” cried Gottlieb, turning a very contemptuous
somerset; “poh! <em>I</em> have: but I
never told though before. It was last Christmas,—that
night, you know, I ran away from
Bert. We went to the avenue, Martin Fischer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
and me, and we saw one. It was in
that big stone house where the Dutchman
lives—Herr Westermann. It was very cold,
and we stood upon the sidewalk, and the
wind blew so hard; but the blinds were
open just a bit, and we saw it! O my!—but
wasn’t it jolly! The great green tree
most up to the top of the wall; and the
lights blazing on every limb; and the gold
and silver nuts shining; and the apples
and oranges and candy!—and O, flowers,
too! and hobby-horses! and dolls!—and all
the children dancing round and laughing!
I tell <em>you</em>, you never saw anything so fine,—never!
never!”</p>

<p>“Did you see the Christ-child, Lieb?”
asked little Rosa, in a tone of awe.</p>

<p>“I saw a little blue angel with gold wings,
quite up in the top of the tree,” answered
Gottlieb; “only its face was turned the other
way.”</p>

<p>“<em>That</em> was He!” cried Rosa, clapping her
hands joyfully. “<em>That</em> was He! O how I
wish I could see Him! Mina Schaeffer says
it is He brings all the things,—only she says
He will never come to us, because we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
poor,—and it is only the rich ones He takes
them to.”</p>

<p>“Fie, Rosa,” said Lina, reprovingly; “don’t
you remember what <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die liebe Mutter</i> said,
how Jesus (He’s the Christ-child, you know)
was very poor, and how the Holy Virgin
laid Him in a manger when He was born. I
don’t believe <em>He</em> would forget us because we
are poor.”</p>

<p>“Will He come, then, do you think?” asked
Rosa, eagerly. “Will He come this Christmas,
if we are very good? Perhaps we were
naughty last year,—I don’t remember,—and
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Mutter</i> said He don’t love us but when
we are good. Let’s be <em>very</em> good now, and
see if He will come.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it is the Christ-child does
it,” said Gottlieb, who had been lying quite
still, thinking, for some time. “I don’t believe
it is the Christ-child does it at all. Mina
Schaeffer knows nothing, and the little blue
angel looked just like a doll. I’ll bet you
it was Herr Westermann bought all those
things, and Frau Westermann put them on
the tree;—only she’s a little woman, I know,
and the tree was very high. But, any way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
I don’t believe it’s the Christ-child does it.
Martin says it isn’t. They had a tree to
Martin’s house once, and he peeped, and he
thought he saw his mother; but then their
tree was little, and Herr Westermann’s was
ever so big.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Frau Westermann had a ladder,”
said Lina, coming to her brother’s assistance
in his puzzle.</p>

<p>“A ladder! to be sure, so she must!” cried
Gottlieb, much relieved. “Yes, you may be
certain she had a ladder.”</p>

<p>“But the tree,” put in little city-bred Rosa;
“where would he get the tree?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, stupid!” answered her brother,
impatiently; “don’t the trees grow, and couldn’t
he cut one and bring it home on a dray?”</p>

<p>“But wouldn’t the policeman catch him
then?” asked poor puzzled Rosa, whose only
idea of trees was of those in the city parks.</p>

<p>“But, Rosa, there are woods,” explained
Lina,—“great fields full of nothing but trees,—that’s
in the country. Mina Schaeffer
went there once to visit her cousin, and she
told me. People may cut them if they like,
and there are no policemen; only I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
think Herr Westermann could bring one on
a dray because it is so far, Lieb. I’ll tell
you, though: I think they bring them on
the railroad to the markets, and then the people
can buy them. I saw some once—very
tall and full of green prickles, and Biddy said
they were for Christmas trees. I guess Herr
Westermann bought his, Lieb.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps he did,” answered Lieb,
sleepily; “and a ladder,—O yes, a ladder!
You may be sure it’s the father and mother
do it, Lina.”</p>

<p>“And we have no father—no mother,”
said Rosa, with a sigh. “We have nobody,—at
least we have only Bert.”</p>

<p>“And Bert could not make a Christmas
tree,” added Lina, sadly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bert tould!” cried little Fritz, giving
Lina a vigorous punch with his stout
little fist. Fritz had been lying broad awake
listening to all this wonderful talk without
understanding it in the least; but he firmly
believed that his Berty could do anything,
and so he felt bound to defend her from
Lina’s assertions. “I tell ’ou,” said he,
“Bert <em>tould</em>,—Bert tould had a laddy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
make a kissmas tee for Fitzy, and the bu
andel tould hep her.”</p>

<p>It was just here, at these words of little
Fritz’s, that the wonderful wish came into
Bertha’s heart, and set it throbbing, so that
the poor child forgot all about her troublesome
work,—noticed no longer the children’s
talk, or the waning candle; but just sat with
her hands clasped in her lap, till the children
were fast asleep and the candle quite burnt
out, thinking and thinking; then crept away
to her place by Fritzy’s side, and lay awake
far into the night, thinking and thinking still.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can guess now what was
Bertha’s wish; at least, if you cannot, you
must be almost as stupid as was Gottlieb
with his ladder.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span> the days passed, and Christmas-tide
drew nearer, Berty’s
wish gained fuller and fuller
possession of her childish heart.
To get a Christmas tree for
these poor little children, who had no father
or mother, who had “only Bert,”—to make
them for once perfectly happy, as happy as
rich Herr Westermann’s boys and girls,—and
to do this all herself,—how delightful,
and yet how impossible the project seemed.</p>

<p>How bright and cheerful the old garret
would appear, lighted up by the glories of
such a tree as the Westermann’s, for Bertha’s
dim German recollections were wonderfully
freshened by Gottlieb’s descriptions; how
her mother would smile from her sweet
rest in Paradise upon the little pale girl
to whose feeble care she had, with such a
failing heart, committed her little ones;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
how sweetly her father would sleep in his
bed there under the sea, if he knew how
happy his darlings were made.</p>

<p>Then the gifts, too. Oh, how Berty’s
imagination revelled in those gifts! Of
course, there must be the blazing tapers,
and the gold and silver nuts, and the apples,
and oranges, and candy; but there
must be also—what?—ah, a little cart for
Fritzy, and—oh yes, a whole row of pewter
soldiers, and a whistle, and a rattle;—only
think of a baby who had never had a
rattle! Then there must be a doll for Rosa,
and perhaps a cradle to rock it in; and Lieb
must have a drum, for he so dearly loves
to make a noise, and perhaps a tin sword
too, and a soldier’s cap;—then he might
“train” with the other boys upon the street,
perhaps even be Captain of a Company:
how Lieb would like that! And Lina
must have a set of dishes, for Lina was
such a tidy little housekeeper she would be
sure to like that best of all. And Berty—ah!
Berty would have <em>done it</em>; surely, that
would be fun enough: Berty was the little
mother; surely, that was joy enough for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>O yes! it was easy enough to arrange all
that; it was easy enough to think <em>what</em> to
get; but <em>how</em> to get it—that was quite
another thing. So, whenever this troublesome
question came up, Berty was fain, for a
long time, to put it out of her head. But at
last the simple child bethought herself that
this question, “How to do it,” was by far
the most important question of the two. If
the Christmas tree was ever to be anything
more than a beautiful dream, this question
must be settled first of all. And so she set
herself resolutely to consider it.</p>

<p>The fairy godmother of Mrs. Flanagan’s
tales was, as I said, the first thought; but
Bertha, having been born in Germany, instead
of Ireland, could never feel quite certain
that she had a fairy godmother. Biddy,
to whom she applied in her perplexity, knew
nothing about German fairies; she could
only speak confidently about the “good little
people” of her own green island, who
were but too fond of children, as she knew;
for had not her own husband’s first cousin
had a child carried off by them, changed in
its cradle for a fairy babe,—a strange little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
being, which never grew older or larger, but
remained always a merry, silly child. Berty
did not like this view of the subject at all:
but for the Christmas tree, she would have
been relieved to know that there was no such
person about, for she had no mind to have
her Fritzy exchanged for any fairy folk. Ah,
if she would but bring the Christmas tree,
and then fly away, and never, never, come
back any more! But, even if she had such
a guardian, how could she be sure that it
had not been left in the “old country,” along
with the rest of their household treasures:
the donkey, the goat, the pet kid, the pink
china shepherdess, the painted tea-set, and
the great old pewter tankard, which she
dimly remembered.</p>

<p>Again she applied to Biddy:—did fairies
ever emigrate? “Whisht, child!” answered
Mrs. Flanagan; “how can I tell? Sure, the
fairy folk are very wise, and is it likely
they’d fash themselves with crossing the
salt wather? And Ameriky’s but a wild
counthry, wid snakes, and bears, and Injuns,—not
tame and tidy like ould Ireland; and
the weeny people could never bide in cities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
They must have their green rings to dance
upon, and all that. Troth, though, I <em>did</em> see
a place in the park whin we wint there the
day, so trim and green I tould Mike it
looked a likely spot for the good folk; but
thin there’s the p’leecemen. Whisht, child,
how can <em>I</em> tell? And why need ye be
talkin’ so much of them? Sure, Berty, they
don’t like it; and it’s not good to vex
them.”</p>

<p>So at last, all things considered, Bertha
came to the conclusion that this fairy godmother
was much too uncertain a personage
to be trusted with such an important and
difficult matter as her Christmas tree. But
she could not manage alone,—how could
she? It was almost impossible for her, with
all the help she had from the kind world, to
get food enough for all those children to
eat, and clothing enough for them to wear:
how could she, whose only living was gained
by picking up what other people threw
away as worthless, hope to indulge in this
luxury of giving, which few of the people
around her, so much better off than herself,
could afford? No, she could never do it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
alone. Who then would help her? Not
Biddy: she was much too poor and too
busy to bother herself with such a matter.
Not Madame Hansmann: she might be willing,
but her cross, beer-drinking son, with
whom she lived, and of whom she stood in
such terror that she never permitted the children
to come to her except when he was
absent, would never allow it. Who, then,
would help her? She had no one else.</p>

<p>“No one else!” It was to this sad conclusion
of all her hopes and schemes that
Berty had come upon the evening when my
story begins, when she sat by the window,
looking up at the dull rainy sky. It was
this dreary thought which made her turn
back, with such a weary sigh, to her unpleasant
work at Gottlieb’s summons. Poor
Berty! the rags had never seemed so filthy,
the bits of iron never so rusty, the whole
basket of odds and ends never so worthless,
as they did that night. She had no sympathy
with Gottlieb’s rejoicing over his two
horse-shoes, no patience with Lina’s lingering
over the bits of an illustrated newspaper;
and, when she crept into her bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
in the darkness, after Gottlieb had returned
from his nightly chaffer with “Moses,” the
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vaterunser</i> was, I am sorry to say, forgotten.</p>

<p>“No one else!” What was it, then, that
put into Berty’s mind, as she lay there
awake in the darkness, brooding over her
fruitless plans, the remembrance of that old
talk of the children which had given rise to
them? What was it made her recall that
sweet thought of little Rosa’s, that it was
the Christ-child brought the gifts,—or that
still sweeter faith of Lina’s, that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> would
never forget them because they were poor.
What was it? Oh, my children! rather,
<em>Who</em> was it? Who but that Friend, the
best and dearest Who watches over us all,
even while we forget Him, and showers
upon us new blessings, even while we are
unthankful for those He has already sent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> would not forget them: they had
no father, no mother; but they still had
Him. I cannot tell you with what a flash
of joy and hope this thought filled little
Bertha’s lonely heart. I suppose you could
never fully understand it until, like Bertha,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
you had “no one else”; which, God grant,
may never be your case; for it is a hard
trial, this having no one else, though it is
an inestimable blessing to have Him. And
so Berty found it when she rose from her
bed, and, kneeling once more by the window,
with her face turned toward the sky,
laid all her cares and hopes and wishes at
His feet.</p>

<p>And I cannot think that Berty was wrong
or foolish in this, even though her trouble
was about such a little thing; for I am
sure that He who cares for the sparrows,
and who has provided so many beautiful
things for us to enjoy, cares even for our
slightest pleasures, and helps us to gain
them when they are right.</p><br>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Upon</span> that same October evening,
another little girl, near Bertha’s
age, sat by the window,
looking out into the twilight.
It was no dreary back-court,
however, which met her eye, but a broad,
well-paved street, lined with stately houses,
and a quiet park, where the graceful willows
drooping round the fountain still showed a
tinge of green, and the elms and maples
still looked gay in their autumn livery of
crimson and gold.</p>

<p>And the scene within presented as strong
a contrast to poor Bertha’s surroundings as
did the scene without. The cheerful parlor,
with its rich curtains and soft carpet, its
glowing grate and pleasant pictures and
comfortable easy-chairs, was very unlike that
dismal attic; but the gazer at the window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
seemed to give very little heed to its brightness.
She, too, was looking up at the cloudy
sky, and, with her pale little face and deep
mourning-dress, made as sad a picture
through the plate-glass window as did poor
ragged Bertha behind her smoky panes.</p>

<p>Presently, however, as a footstep sounded
along the pavement and up the steps, the
pale, sad face lighted up and turned eagerly
toward the door. A handsome, merrylooking,
young gentleman came briskly in,
shaking a tiny shower of rain-drops from his
hair and dress. “Were you counting the
rain-drops, Polly?” said he, “or looking for
the moon?”</p>

<p>“No, cousin John; I was only thinking.”</p>

<p>“<em>Only</em> thinking!” said cousin John, wheeling
the most inviting easy-chair up in front
of the glowing grate. “Well, come here and
sit with me, and, if you must stare at something,
let it be at the fire: it is a much
more agreeable object than that mizzly sky.
And so you were thinking, Polly? I hoped
you were watching for me.”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/30.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">MARY’S HOME.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I was wishing for you, cousin John.
But I wasn’t exactly watching, because I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>was thinking of <em>them</em>;”—and the child
clasped her hands nervously, and turned
her face up to him with a sorrowful look,
which was sadder than tears.</p>

<p>A shadow came over the young man’s
pleasant face; and he stooped and kissed
her forehead, as he placed her on his knee.
“You shouldn’t sit here alone in the twilight,
Polly,” said he; “it’s not good for
you. Where are the babies?”</p>

<p>“Grandmamma does not like them to stay
in the parlor, you know: they make such a
litter; and she wants it tidy when you come
home; and Mrs. Evans says I sha’n’t be always
in the nursery.”</p>

<p>“Grandmamma mustn’t sacrifice you to
my old-bachelor notions, puss. I had rather
stumble over a dozen hobby-horses than to
find my little Polly sitting here alone with
such a dismal face.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> like it to be neat for you, too, cousin
John,” said cousin John’s little Polly, as he
drew the kind caressing arm closer round her;
“and I don’t think Grandmamma would have
made the rule; but the last time they were
in here, Jamie got the poker, and rode upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
it all round the room. He called it his gee-gee.
Look, what a black mark he made in
the carpet. Nancy scrubbed it ever so long
this morning, and it won’t come out; and
the black was all over his new scarlet frock,
too. Then Jeannie climbed on a chair, to get
the dollies,—she thinks those marble busts
are dollies,—and she fell and bumped her
head. Mrs. Evans says it will be black and
blue for a month. Oh, how angry she was!
She said they were spoiled. Sylvie never
said so; and Sylvie let me stay with them
as much as I liked. Poor Sylvie!”—and
the child’s voice sank into a tone of sad
complaint.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Evans is a bit of a tyrant, I
know,” answered cousin John, cheerfully;
“but she is very fond of the twins, and of
their big sister too, I can tell you. But
where’s Grandmamma to-night?”</p>

<p>“Aunt Emily came and took her home to
tea. She asked me, too; but, oh, cousin
John, they do pity me so much, and ask so
many questions about <em>it</em>,—all those old
ladies,—that I can’t bear it. But she said
you were to come, and I was to tell you the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
instant you came in, but I forgot. Shall
you go?”</p>

<p>“Shall I, Polly? I leave you to decide.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cousin! will you? And may I tell
you to stay? I want you so much: only I
don’t wish to be selfish; and aunt Emily
said you and Grandmamma were dreadfully
moped with us children.”</p>

<p>“Are we?” said cousin John, smiling.
“I’m much obliged to aunt Emily; I never
should have guessed it without her help. I
thought it was very nice to have a little
Polly to welcome me home every evening,
and to be company for Grandmamma all day;
and I am sure the house was never so lively
as it is since Jemmy and Jenny came. <em>I</em>
should have said, now, if any one had
asked me, that it was aunt Emily’s tea-parties
which moped us; but then, of course,
she knows.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you are moped at all,”
said Polly, energetically; “you are always
so bright and merry, or, when you are sad,
it is not in a stupid way. I wonder at
you sometimes, cousin John. You are just
like me,—that is, I mean you have no father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
and mother; and you have not even the
twins;—you have only Grandma in all the
world, and yet you seem so happy, while I
can do nothing but cry.”</p>

<p>“<em>Only</em> Grandmamma! Why, Polly, I
should not be so very poor in friends, even
if you were right. Grandma counts for a
great deal with her Johnny, I can tell you.
But I thought myself richer than that. I
thought I had you, my little cousin, and the
twins. Don’t you mean to give me any
share in the twins?”</p>

<p>“Oh, cousin John! I didn’t mean <em>that</em>!”
cried the little girl, very earnestly. “I’m
sure I love you better than anybody in the
world,—at least now,—and Jemmy and
Jenny are always calling for ‘Cuddy.’
They never call papa or brother now; and
nurse won’t let me put them in mind, because
she says it does them no good and
only makes me cry. Oh no! I did not
mean that. I meant people that belong to
you,—people that you have a right to.”</p>

<p>“And I insist that I have a right to you,
Polly,” said the young gentleman, pressing
Polly very tight in his arms. “But I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
what you mean, puss, and I won’t tease
you any more. Indeed, I have been wishing
to talk with you a little about this for some
time; and, now we have begun it, perhaps I
had better say my say. I know very well
how sad it is to be an orphan, and I have
seen the time, at first, when, like you, I
could do nothing but cry; so, I don’t mean
to set myself up for an example; but, my
little Mary, there is one thing which you
and I must both remember, and which
ought to help us very much, and that is
this: whatever our trials are, they are
sent by One who knows much better than
we do what is good for us, and for those we
love; and whatever our blessings are, they
come to us straight from His hand. If we
believe this,—as I try to do, as I hope you
also try to do,—it will make us afraid to
murmur at the one, and ashamed to be unthankful
for the other,—will it not?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; I suppose it ought,” said
Mary, slowly; “but, oh, cousin John, it is so
very hard. You are a man, and you are so
very good you would be sure to feel just
right; but I am only a little girl, and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
so very hard, so very different. You and
Grandma are very kind, but, oh, I want papa
so much, and mamma, and Ned! Oh, cousin,
you don’t know! It seems sometimes as
if my heart would break!”—and the child
leaned her head against her cousin’s shoulder,
and wept as if her heart were really
breaking.</p>

<p>The young man soothed her very tenderly,
and waited patiently until her tears were
dried; then he said, gently, “My darling must
not think I mean to blame her, but only to
help her bear her trouble better. I know
it is sad, very sad, to lose so many dear
friends at one blow; but Polly must count
up her blessings as well as her trials: she
has not been left quite helpless and friendless,
as so many poor children are, by this
same fearful Providence.”</p>

<p>“That is what nurse is always saying,”
answered Mary, a little impatiently; “but I
can’t see that it makes my trial any easier.
I’m sure it only makes me more wretched
to think of other people being so miserable.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it does have that effect,”
answered cousin John, thoughtfully, “unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
one tries to help them. Yes, Polly, strange
as it may seem, the only way to lighten our
own burdens is by helping other people to
bear theirs.”</p>

<p>There was not a shadow of vexation in
his tone; and yet, somehow, Mary could not
help feeling that her cousin was not quite
pleased with her,—perhaps because she was
not quite pleased with herself. She was
conscious of being unthankful for her remaining
blessings; she knew she had felt inclined
to murmur at her lot, and to indulge her
grief without any regard to the comfort of
those around her. But she felt she had great
excuse,—as, indeed, she had, if any one can
be said to have excuse for doing what is not
quite right; for this little Mary’s trials were
no common ones.</p>

<p>I dare say my young readers have already
guessed that Mary was an orphan, but I
hope they are not familiar enough with sorrow
to have guessed in what a terrible form
her bereavement came. Perhaps some of
you may remember, however, to have heard
or read of the fearful pestilence at Norfolk in
Virginia, a few years ago, when the yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
fever passed through the city and carried off
its victims from every house. It was at
Norfolk that little Mary’s parents lived; and
it was this terrible disease which had robbed
her, in a single week, of her father, her mother,
her eldest brother, and Sylvie, her faithful
black nurse. Poor little Mary! well might she
shudder and turn pale as she remembered that
fearful day when she found herself alone with
the twin babies, with only those strange doctors
and nurses to care for them. Well might
she cling, too, to the dear cousin who had
braved the pestilence to come to their relief.</p>

<p>The grandmother’s house was of course
open to the orphans. They had already
been with her two months when my story
begins, and the twin babies had become
quite wonted to their new nursery, grown
very fond of “ganny,” as they called her,
very familiar with “Cuddy,” as they styled
young Dr. Grey, and seemed to have adopted
Nurse Evans into the place of their lost
Sylvie; but little Mary was still, I am sorry
to say, not only very sad but very discontented.
She had taken up a sad complaining
way, brooding over her grief, and refusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
to be comforted; contrasting her grandmother’s
quiet, sober ways with her mamma’s
sweet brightness, and Mrs. Evans’s
strictness with poor Sylvie’s indulgence.</p>

<p>Dr. John was the only person who could
soothe or divert her; for she chose to believe
that he, an orphan himself, left from childhood
to his grandmother’s care, was the only
one who could fully sympathize with her
great trouble. She was very fond of him;
and now, though a little vexed at his seeming
reproof, could not bear the thought of displeasing
him: so, after a moment’s thought,
she took his hand caressingly in both her
own, and said, “I am so little, cousin John,
and so silly, I don’t see how I could help
other people any; but if you want me to,
I’ll try,—only you must tell me how.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how I learned what little I
know about it, Polly,” answered Dr. Grey,
kindly. “When I first came here, it was
with me, I suppose, very much as it is with
you now. I pined for the dear ones I had
lost, and found this great empty house very
lonely and dreary. I thought no one had
ever been so afflicted as I, and I indulged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
my grief without giving a thought to other
people’s feelings, until, one night, Grandma
and I sat here in this very parlor. I was
moping by the window, just as you were
when I came in. I thought of that night
when I saw you here, looking so doleful; and
dear Grandma sat by the fire with her knitting
in her lap. She was not so old a woman as
now by a good many years, but she seemed
to me every whit as aged; and I confess I
thought it something of a bore that there
should be no younger people in the house.
She had been trying hard to wile me into a
little cheerful talk, but I was obstinate; so
she had finally given it over, and sat there
thinking, with her hands folded over the work
in her lap. I don’t know what prompted me
to peep out at her from my sullen nook in
the window-seat, but I did, and I never shall
forget the weary, sorrowful, jaded look upon
that dear old face. Perhaps you have seen it,
Polly; it has come back once or twice since
you came. It came over me all at once then,
that I was not the only sufferer; that, if I
had lost my parents, dear Grandma had lost
her only son; if I was lonely in my orphan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
childhood, she must be still more so in her
widowed age; and that I, who should have
been her comfort, was adding to her trouble
by my selfish grief. I can’t tell you how I
felt, Mary; but I remember I jumped from
the window-seat, and sat down upon the
footstool at Grandma’s feet, and leaned my
head against her knee. The kind old smile
came back then, and I made a great vow to
myself to keep it there. I have tried; I
don’t know if I have succeeded always; but
one thing I do know, Polly: I have never felt
myself quite desolate since that night. I
have never wished for any one younger than
Grandma either; and I hope, I believe, I have
filled, in some measure, the place of the son
she then lost. But the dear old patient heart
has got a fresh wound now, Polly: she has
lost a daughter now; another orphan grandchild
is weeping in her home; and the old
look of sadness and weariness has come back.
I can’t banish it alone this time, Polly. Will
you help me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what you mean!” cried Mary,
bursting into tears; “I know what you mean.
I have seen the look. It was on her face to-night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
when I would not go with her, and
aunt Emily would insist upon taking her
away. But I did not mind it as you did. I
never thought she could care so much for
mamma; but I see now: if I had died, dear
mamma would have been so sad, so sorry.
Yes, I <em>will</em> try, cousin John,—I <em>will</em>!”</p>

<p>“I knew you would, my darling; and, I
am sure, Grandma will be very happy in her
little daughter.”</p>

<p>“Her little daughter,” repeated Polly, drying
her eyes, and brightening up, as if that
put the subject in a new light. “That is
like being your little sister, isn’t it? I like
that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dr. John, “my little sister,—Grandma’s
boy and girl. I like it too, Polly,
very much.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be ever so good, won’t we? But,
cousin John, you’ve only told me about
Grandmamma, and you said there were
others. How did you learn to help the
others?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t done learning that yet, Polly;
so we can study together, and, if we have but
the motive, I dare say we shall find a way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
lighten the burden of many a weary fellow-traveller.”</p>

<p>“What is the motive, cousin John?”</p>

<p>Dr. John made no answer to this question
in words; but he took his grandmother’s
great Bible from the stand beside him, and
turning over the leaves, put his finger on a
passage, and held it up to the fire-light for
Polly to read. The child made out the words
slowly by the flickering light: “Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least of
these my brethren, ye have done it unto
me”; then looked up in his face and asked,
in a frightened tone, “Do you think He
really meant <em>that</em>, cousin John?”</p>

<p>“We have His own Word for it, Polly,”
answered Dr. John; “and is not that motive
enough? Is there anything, <em>any</em>thing, we
should not be willing to do for Him?”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Berty</span> rose next morning with
the firm belief that her wish
was to be granted, though in
what way she could not tell.
She was not so unreasonable
as to expect the coveted pleasure to fall from
the sky in answer to her prayers, however;
and so she could not help feeling some curiosity
about the means by which it was to
come to her. Was it to be given her, or
was she to be helped to earn it? The first
plan seemed very unlikely, for she knew no
one who had both the means and the will
to do so much for her; and the second
seemed, at first thought, more unlikely still,
but she was fain to settle upon it at last,
as being the more probable of the two. Yes:
she would be very diligent in her work; and
who knew but she might find something
very valuable in the gutter, or do some great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
service to the people at the crossing, and so
get money enough.</p>

<p>But how much money would it take, was
another question, and a very puzzling question
to poor Bertha, whose acquaintance with
the prices current was very slight indeed. In
this emergency she applied once more to
Mrs. Flanagan. “Biddy, how much does a
Christmas tree cost? Do you know?”</p>

<p>“A Christmas tree! Faix, Berty, what a
child ye are for axin’ questions’. Sure they
don’t be havin’ such toys in ould Ireland;
and I niver bought one. Pounds and pounds,
I suppose; but your Dutch folks be talkin’
of thim so much, they’d be liker to know
than I.”</p>

<p>“And how many cents is in a pound, Mrs.
Flanagan?”</p>

<p>“How many cints? Sure, child, I niver
reckoned. There’s betune four and five dollars,
I know; but I niver could remember
rightly how much, to a penny,—the money’s
so bothersome in this counthry.”</p>

<p>“And there’s one hundred cents in a dollar,
I know: Tim Daly told me,” pursued
Berty. “Pounds and pounds; and four hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
cents to a pound. Oh, dear! oh, dear!
Mrs. Flanagan, do you think I could ever
earn so much?”</p>

<p>“Hear till the child now! Is she crazy,
d’ye think?” cried Biddy, in amazement.
“Sure, you’re niver thinkin’ of buyin’ a Christmas
tree! you, that haven’t shoes to yer
feet, nor clothes to yer back, nor food to yer
stomach!”</p>

<p>Poor Berty! the good Irishwoman’s words
fell upon her heart with a heavier weight
than even the “pounds and pounds”; but
she would not wait to hear more,—she <em>would</em>
not be talked out of her project at the very
beginning,—so she caught up her broom
and her basket, and scampered away as fast
as her bare little feet could carry her.</p>

<p>Once safe round the corner, out of reach
of Mrs. Flanagan’s astonished gaze, Bertha
began to walk slower, and to revolve again
in her mind that weary question of ways and
means, which has puzzled so many wiser heads
than hers. It was so hard to settle what to
do; some adviser she must have; but who?
She could not consult with her little prime
minister, Gottlieb, for the project would lose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
half its charm if it were not to be a surprise
to him. She thought of her Dutch acquaintance;
doubtless they would know all about
it; but she remembered Biddy’s amazement,
and she had no mind to encounter a second
edition of that. No; she wanted no prudent
old heads shaking themselves so provokingly
over her wild plan. What she wanted, after
all, was some one to sympathize rather than
advise.</p>

<p>“The top o’ the morning to ye, Berty,”
cried a pleasant, cheery voice, breaking in
upon her meditations; and her heart leapt
within her at the sound of the merry brogue,
and the sight of the round, rosy face of the
little speaker. Here was just the adviser she
wanted. Tim Daly, her master in the rag-picker’s
arithmetic, her protector in all her
street troubles,—honest, merry, wise, kind-hearted,
blundering Tim, who always looked
upon the bright side of everything, who always
had a word of encouragement for everybody,—who
could be a better confidant than
he?</p>

<p>So she turned upon the young Irishman a
brighter glance of welcome even than he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
was accustomed to get. “Oh, I <em>so</em> glad to
see you, Tim!” said she. “You’re just the
very one I wanted.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s good to be welcome, any way,”
said Tim, who cared more for Berty’s smiles
than he would have been willing to confess.
“It’s good to be welcome. An’ what were
ye wanting of me, Berty?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Tim,” answered Berty, eagerly.
“I’ve got such a wonderful plan; and
I can’t tell Gottlieb, you see, because it’s
part to be for him; and I want somebody to
talk it over with; and you’re better than any
one.”</p>

<p>“Am I, though?” asked Tim, straightening
himself up grandly. “You’re the <em>broth</em>
of a boy, Berty.” Tim thought it very nice
to be better than any one to Berty, you see;
and as for Berty herself, she seemed quite
contented to be called the “broth of a boy,”
though it certainly sounded very much as if
Tim was a cannibal, and not a very good
judge of child-soup at that.</p>

<p>“Yes Tim,” said she, “you are,—because
you’ve some sense, and you won’t fly out at
one like Mrs. Biddy, I know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll never fly out at you, Berty, that’s
sure,” said Tim, confidently.</p>

<p>“Well, then, you see, it’s just this:—There’s
those poor children,—Lieb, and
Lina, and Rose. They were so little when
we came from the old country,—and Fritzy,
he wasn’t born,—and none of them ever
saw a Christmas tree in all their lives;”—and
Berty held her breath here, as if she
had made a very astonishing statement.</p>

<p>“No more have I,” said Tim; “but
that’s nayther here nor there, Berty. Go
on.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you?” said Berty, casting a pitying
glance up at the merry face beside her,
and mentally fastening a present for Tim
upon the green branches of her imaginary
tree. “Well, neither did they; and Madame
Hansmann, you see, has told them
about it, and their heads are full of it. I
heard them the other night talking, and wishing,
and they said they could not have it
because they had no father, no mother,—nobody
but Bert. And oh, Tim, I promised
mother to do <em>every</em>thing for those children;
and I wish so much, so very much, to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
this. Oh, Tim, do you think I could? and
will you help me?” finished up poor Berty,
in a choking voice.</p>

<p>“‘Deed an’ I will, Berty,” cried Tim, with
an encouraging slap upon Berty’s shoulder;
“and ov course ye can do it. Sure, I’ve got
fifty cints that I was laying by for the winter
shoes; but what’s shoes to a Christmas
tree? Sure, we’ll get it betune us, Berty.
Don’t ye cry; we’ll get it, sure as fate.”</p>

<p>This was rather more help than Berty had
bargained for. She did not at all like the
notion of robbing Tim of his shoes; for, if
the truth must be told, she was much more
tender of Tim’s feet than of her own.</p>

<p>“Oh no, Tim,” said she, earnestly; “I did
not mean <em>that</em>. I don’t want you to help
me with money, for I mean to earn it all
myself; and I have prayed, and I know that
the Christ-child (that’s Jesus, you know)
will help me. I’m going to look sharp in
the gutters, and I shall find heaps of things;
or else I shall do something for the passengers,
and they’ll pay me ever so much. I’m
not afraid about the money; but you see
I’m not wise,—I can’t count much. Will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
you help me count the pennies, when I get
them, and keep them for me till we get
enough,—so Lieb shall not guess,—and
go with me to buy the tree and things, so
the market-men and the toy-sellers shall not
cheat me. Only there’s one thing I want
to buy all myself, and you mustn’t look
then. Will you, Tim?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tim, who had a famous project
in his head of counting his own pennies
in with Berty’s, and never telling her; “yes,
Berty, I’ll do everything you ask me,—certain
sure.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s all settled,” cried Berty, with a
long sigh of satisfaction, the tapers of her
Christmas tree shining brightly in her mind’s
eye as she spoke,—“quite settled at last.
And, Tim, here’s my crossing, and yonder’s
yours; and you’ll see—you’ll see what a
pile of pennies I’ll have to-night!”</p>

<p>“Well; good luck to you, Berty,” answered
Tim, and scampered off.</p>

<p>If you had been near to watch little Berty
that morning, I am sure you would have
thought her the most industrious little rag-picker
in all New York. She turned over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
very carefully the sweepings of the shops,
ransacked all the rubbish in the gutters, and
swept patiently at her crossing, keeping a
sharp eye to the passengers meanwhile, for
any chance to do them service; and yet, when
she sat down, quite tired out, upon the curb-stone
to eat her crust at noon, she had in her
basket only the usual amount of cabbagestumps,
and rags, and rusty nails, and in
her pocket only the two pennies which a
pleasant-looking gentleman had tossed her as
he stepped out of the stage at the crossing.</p>

<p>It was very discouraging. And Tim, too,
who scarcely ever failed to come round now
and then for a bit of friendly chat, had never
been near her all day. Berty was almost
glad, since she had nothing to show him;
and yet it gave her a forsaken feeling, which,
added to the discouragement, almost made
her cry.</p>

<p>By and by a drizzly rain came on, soaking
her thin garments, chilling her blood, and
making the bright tapers of the imaginary
tree look very dim and distant through its
dismal mist. Yet Berty would not allow
herself to lose heart entirely: this was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
famous time for the crossing, if only people
would not be in such a hurry; for everybody
was crowding to the stages to escape
the rain. Perhaps, if she kept it very neat,
so that the ladies should not soil their fine
dresses, nor the gentlemen their shining
boots, some of them might be grateful
enough to fling her now and then a penny;
and Berty did not think a penny so small
now as she had done in the morning. At
any rate she would try.</p>

<p>So she took her broom and swept away
vigorously; and, sure enough, the pennies did
come, one after another, ringing down upon
the clean pavement, till Berty had counted
ten; and then along came her pleasant-looking
gentleman of the morning, and he tossed
her a dime, with such a cheery smile, too,
that Berty’s heart quite glowed within her,
and the tapers shone out again brighter than
ever.</p>

<p>But what was this which came tumbling
down upon the pavement as the loaded stage
rolled off,—not ringing at all, but with a
heavy thump? Berty picked it up. A
pocket-book of purple Russia leather, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
fat and full. Whose could it be? The
pleasant-looking gentleman’s? Very likely;
for Berty remembered that he was the last
to step upon the platform. So she held it
up and shouted, and ran after the stage a
moment; but nobody heeded, and she could
never overtake it, that was certain. What
should she do? Give it to the policeman?
Doubtless he knew where the gentleman lived;
policemen knew everything. Berty looked
round, but, for a wonder, there was no policeman
near. What should she do then?
Take it to the station-house, or wait till the
stage came down again and hand it to the
conductor? He knew the gentleman, for she
had seen them nod to each other. But what
if he should not give it up; what, if he
should keep it?</p>

<p>“<em>Keep it!</em>” What was there in that
thought to make Berty’s heart beat so, and
her head grow giddy? What was there to
make her clinch the pocket-book tighter, and
hide it in her dress, and glance round to see
if any one was looking? Was it a good
angel, think you, that whispered in Berty’s
ear at this moment—“<em>Keep it!</em> If any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
is to keep it, why not you? You did not
see him lose it; how do you know to whom
it belongs? You found it in the street; and
what is found in the street belongs to the
sweepers. And you prayed, too; how can
you tell but this is an answer to your prayer?
It is a good fat one. Surely, it holds enough
to buy a Christmas tree. Look at it and
see if it does not.”</p>

<p>It might have been an angel; very likely
it was; but, truly, I think such angels are
very poor help in growing Christmas trees.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Tim</span> came back to the crossing
towards night, his round face
rosier and merrier than ever,
and a new little splint basket
on his arm, which Berty would
have wondered over at any other time, but
did not notice now. She sat upon the
curb-stone with her basket beside her, and
her hands folded in her lap, thinking as intently
as on the night when we found her
at the attic window. But there was a flush
on her face, and a strange look of care in
her eyes, for which Tim could not account,
and which he thought boded little good to
the wished-for tree. Still, Tim thought he
carried the cure for all such trouble in his
breeches’ pocket, if he could but get Berty
to take it. So he began, cautiously, “Well,
Berty, so you’re waiting, for me; how goes
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>The child turned and looked at him vacantly,
but did not answer. “Bad enough?”
said Tim, sitting down beside her. “Well,
honey, never mind. You’ll let yer own Tim
help ye, sure ye will. An’ he’s a rich man
the night. Faix, it’s not a rag-picker he is
at all any more, but an apple-boy; hooroo!
Whist, Berty,” he added, as the girl started
nervously at this outburst. “Whist, Berty,
an’ I’ll tell ye. I had a bright thought whin I
left ye the morn; an’ I just scampered home
an’ tuk the fifty cints from the ould stockin’
fut, where uncle Teddy bade me keep ’em;
an’ I wint to the market an’ bought this tidy
basket, d’ye see? an’ filled it wid apples
from a stall; an’ then I wint down to the
ferry an’ sold ’em. And whin the apples
were all gone, I filled it wid oranges; an’
whin the oranges were gone, I filled it wid
chestnuts; an’ whin the chestnuts was gone,
I filled it wid pennies, d’ye see?”—and,
suiting the action to the word, Tim poured
a jingling stream of pennies from his pocket
into the basket.</p>

<p>“There, darlint,” said he, coaxingly, placing
the basket upon Berty’s knee. “There, darlint,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
ye won’t mourn for yer luck now any
more. Ye’ll just let yer own Tim help ye.
Sure, ye know, Berty, I’ve no one but meself
to care for. Uncle Teddy’s not depindent on
me; an’ you’ve all those childer;—so, it’s
only fair—”</p>

<p>“Tim,” said Berty, grasping the boy’s arm,
and speaking in a frightened whisper, “Tim,
come with me. I want to show you something.”</p>

<p>Tim caught the basket as Berty heedlessly
rose, and, without speaking, followed her—still
holding his arm—down a neighboring
alley. He had never seen his little friend
look, or act, so strangely, and he was curious
to know what it meant. When they came
to a quiet, out-of-the-way spot, Berty stopped,
and putting her hand in her bosom,
drew out the pocket-book, and held it up before
him, saying, still in the same frightened
whisper, “There, Tim, see what I found!”</p>

<p>“A pocket-book! Oh, Berty, let’s see!”</p>

<p>“Hush, Tim!” gasped Berty, “don’t
speak so loud; and here, come in the corner,
behind this water-butt. Now, Tim,
open it and count it, and tell me if there’s
enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Tim took the book, and, loosening the elastic
band, spread it out before them as they sat
upon the sidewalk. The numerous red pockets
were famously lined. There were rolls
of bank-notes, drafts, checks, and in one little
flapped pocket a handful of shining gold.
“Why, Berty!” cried Tim, almost breathless
with amazement, “<em>I</em> could never count it.
It would take a bank-teller to do that. Sure,
there’s money enough to buy a dozen Christmas
trees.”</p>

<p>“Is there?” said Berty, clutching eagerly
at it. “Is there? Then there’s surely enough
to buy one. Give it to me, Tim; let me
put it away. Somebody’ll be coming along.”</p>

<p>Tim caught the grasping hand in one of
his, and held the pocket-book firmly in the
other. “Where did you get it, Berty?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Berty’s head drooped a little, and the color
flushed up to her temples. “I told you,
Tim,” she answered: “I found it.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but where?”</p>

<p>“In the street.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know who it belongs
to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“How should I?” said Berty, growing redder
still, and wrenching impatiently at the
detained little hand. “Give it to me, Tim;
it’s mine.”</p>

<p>Tim looked gravely down at the pocket-book,
which he had closed and fastened, and
then back again at Berty’s face. The strange
look there was getting a meaning in it which
he did not like at all. “Berty,” said he, freeing
her hand at last, and pointing with his
finger to a row of gilt letters upon one side
of the book, “do you see that? That’s the
owner’s name and number. We’ve got to
take this to the station. That’s all the business
we’ve got with it.”</p>

<p>“You sha’n’t, Tim! It’s mine, I tell you!
You’ve got no business with it at all. Give
it here, I say!” cried Berty, snatching the
pocket-book from his hand, and hiding it
again in her bosom.</p>

<p>Tim made no attempt to recover it. He
stood looking at Berty for a moment, with
a mixture of grief and astonishment in his
face, and then said, slowly, “Well, Berty
Weisser, I never thought that of you, any
way. It’s no better than stealing,—not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
bit. Oh, Berty! Oh, Berty! come wid it to
the station. Come now! Sure, you wouldn’t
be a thief, I know. Come, Berty, come.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, Tim,” cried Berty, passionately.
“It’s mine, I tell you! I found it in the
street. What we find in the street is ours;
you know it is. You are bad, Tim, you are
cruel, to call me such names. I hate you!
I won’t stay to hear you!” and the child put
both hands to her ears and ran away, with
all the speed she could muster, towards her
home.</p>

<p>Tim’s first impulse, of course, was to run
after her; so he followed, shouting to her to
stop,—the pennies in his basket keeping up
a jingling accompaniment to his cries and
his pattering feet. Berty, however, paid no
attention, but ran on and on, without looking
round or slacking her pace, until she
found herself safe in her attic, with the door
closed and bolted against her pursuer.</p>

<p>Tim stopped at the foot of the garret-stairs,
and sat down upon the lowest step,
quite breathless with his chase. Uncle Teddy’s
room opened upon the same landing,
and the merry little Irishman sat at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
door smoking his pipe in the twilight, and
laughing heartily at his nephew’s ill luck.
“What’s come to your sweetheart, Tim?”
said he; “she tore up the stairs like mad.”</p>

<p>“She is mad, I think,” answered Tim,
wiping his forehead, and looking ruefully up
the stairs towards Berty’s room.</p>

<p>“Well, leave her alone for a little, and
she’ll come to; it’s the way of them all,”
counselled Uncle Teddy. “But what’s that
you have there, Tim?”</p>

<p>Tim looked down at his basket, and the
ghost of a smile lighted up his face again.
“It’s pennies, Uncle,” said he. “I’ve set up
for an apple-boy the day; and see, I made
all these from the fifty cints we laid by for
the shoes. There’s a dollar and ten cints.”</p>

<p>“Is there though? Ye’re a sharp lad,
Tim. It’s half as much as I’ve airned meself.
Put it by and take care of it, lad.
Well, I’m goin’ out for a bit,” he added,
knocking the ashes from his pipe, “and ye
can come wid me, if ye like, Tim,—just for
once in a way.”</p>

<p>“No, Uncle,” said Tim; “I’ll bide here, I
think; I’m tired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Very tired was Tim, and very sad, and
sorely puzzled about what he was to do.
There was his little venture, so successful,
and yet so useless; there was Berty, whom
he loved better than all the world, hiding
away from him, calling him cruel and declaring
she hated him; and there was the pocket-book,
of which he felt himself become in
some mysterious way the especial guardian,
taken out of his reach. But, worse than
all, harder than all, for poor, honest, warm-hearted
Tim to bear, was the thought that
this little Berty, whom he had first learned
to love because she seemed so much better
than other children, the remembrance of
whose goodness and purity had kept him
from many a boyish transgression, was going
wrong, was setting her heart upon keeping
what did not belong to her. Oh, if she
would but heed him! Oh, if she would but
listen to reason! Perhaps she would now;
perhaps she was cooler, and would talk the
matter over. He could at least try. So he
crept softly up the stairs to Berty’s door.
It was quite dark by this time, and all
was quiet within. He put his lips to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
crack in the panel and called, “Berty! let
me in. I want to spake wid ye.” Then he
laid his ear to the crack and listened, but
heard no sound. She could not be asleep
so soon. “Berty, honey!” he called again,
coaxingly. “<em>Do</em> let me in.”</p>

<p>“Go away, Tim,” answered a hoarse whisper
close to his ear. “Go away. You’ll
wake the children, and they must not know.”</p>

<p>No, the children must <em>not</em> know. Tim
agreed with her there. The children must
never guess upon the brink of what a precipice
their sister stood.</p>

<p>“Come out to me, then, Berty,” he whispered,
softly; “they’ll not hear.”</p>

<p>“No; go away. I’ll not come out. You’ll
be trying to get it. Go away, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” said Tim, earnestly. “I
promise you I won’t. I only want to talk a
little. Come, now,—there’s a dear girl,—come.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, I tell you,” said Berty, decidedly.
“I don’t want to talk with you, Tim. You
call me names. Go away.”</p>

<p>Tim saw he was losing ground, for he
knew from Berty’s voice that she was getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
in a passion again; and of all things he
dreaded that. What had come to his gentle
Berty to get in a passion so easily? At any
rate, they must part good friends, or he felt
he had no chance left of winning her to a
better mind.</p>

<p>“Berty,” said he again, in his most persuasive
tone,—“Berty dear, you’re not vexed
wid me? Say you’re not.”</p>

<p>“Go off, I say, Tim; go away.”</p>

<p>“Say good night, then, Berty, and I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Tim.”</p>

<p>There was a shadow of relenting in the
voice this time; and poor Tim was fain to
carry off this drop of comfort in his heart
without running the risk of losing it by staying
longer: so he put his lips to the crack
again, and whispered softly, “Good night,
Berty dear;” then added, with a sudden impulse,
“Say your prayers before you go to
sleep,” and ran away down-stairs again, to
discuss with himself once more that momentous
question—what to do.</p>

<p>One thing seemed plain, however, through
all the puzzle: he must keep an eye on
Berty so long as she had that pocket-book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
in her possession,—to save her, if possible,
from herself, and to guard this property which
had been so strangely committed to his care.
So he got his blanket from uncle Teddy’s
room, and curled himself up in it at the foot
of the stairs. None of the lodgers, except
Berty, came down that staircase; and she
should never come down without his knowledge.
So much was settled then. But what
next? Should he send uncle Teddy to the
station-house in the morning? The policemen
would come then, perhaps, and drag
poor Berty away to the tombs. Oh no, he
could never do that! Berty would have a
right to call him cruel,—she would have a
right to hate him, if he did that. What then?
Should he find out the stranger and let him
know where his property was? Perhaps that
would be best; perhaps the gentleman was
a kind one, who would even give Berty something
for keeping it safe.</p>

<p>But Berty would never let him see the
pocket-book again,—never. Could he remember
the number and the name? Ah, yes,
“John Grey”; he had made that out quite
distinctly;—that was the name. But about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
the number he was not so sure; indeed he
was not sure that he had read it at all;—he
had only noticed something printed after the
name, which he had taken for granted was a
number. And now all at once it flashed upon
him that it was not a number, but two letters—M. D.
Yes, he saw it quite plainly with
his mind’s eye now,—“John Grey, M. D.”
But what did M. D. mean? And how was
he to find the gentleman if there was no
number? Poor Tim! he was getting sorely
puzzled and very sleepy; and so at last, lest
he should forget them, he got upon his knees
and murmured his <em>Ave Maria</em> and his <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Paternoster</i>,—and
one little Irish-English prayer,
which perhaps mounted higher than either,
that the dear <span class="smcap">Jesu</span> would watch over him
and Berty, and keep them from evil, and
help them to do right, and bring them safe
out of their trouble at last; and then laid
down again and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Yes, children, I am sorry to say Tim was
a Papist, and knew no better than to pray to
the Virgin, who, if she heard him, was doubtless
more sorry than you or I can be; but
Tim was an honest, faithful boy, who tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
with all his might to do his duty to God and
his neighbor according to the light that was
given him; and therefore I have a great respect
for those Latin prayers of his, which,
little as he understood them, were doubtless
more acceptable than many an English one
which goes up from a less earnest heart.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> Tim had meant to revenge
himself for all Berty’s crossness,
he could not have chosen any
means more certain than his
parting-words to do it. In the
tumult of her thoughts, and her anxiety to
get rid of Gottlieb’s questions about the
basket and broom, which in her haste she
had left unheeded upon the sidewalk, Berty
had hurried herself and the children into bed
without remembering her usual devotions.
But those words of Tim’s, “Say your prayers
before you go to sleep,” brought the remembrance,
and somehow it was strangely unwelcome.
She sat down upon the bedside, after
Tim was gone, to think it over. If the pocket-book
had been sent, as she tried to persuade
herself, in answer to her prayers, she ought
at least to be willing to thank her Father in
Heaven for such great and unexpected kindness;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
and yet for her life she dared not have
done it. If it was God’s gift, it should fill her
heart with love and thankfulness. Whence
came, then, this anger and terror? Berty
would not let herself understand,—would
not allow herself to answer,—but crept into
bed again with the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vaterunser</i> still unsaid,
though not forgotten.</p>

<p>But the sleep which settled so sweetly
over Tim’s hard couch held aloof from the
straw bed in the attic. Berty tossed and
tumbled in feverish unrest,—or lay in silent
terror listening to the footsteps of the late
lodgers coming in, and fancying they were
policemen seeking for her,—or magnifying
the rats in the ceiling into robbers, breaking
in to steal her treasure. She tried to put
the pocket-book out of her head, but it lay
there like a leaden weight in her bosom, and
would not be forgotten; she tried to think
of her Christmas tree, but the shining tapers
were all gone out and would not be relighted.
The face of the strange gentleman
would come up in their stead; but the cheery
smile which had warmed her heart so, burned
into it now like a red-hot iron. And Tim’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
words, too,—those bad, cruel words, “It’s
no better than stealing, not a bit; and you
would not be a thief, Berty,”—came back
again and again. And so the night wore
on,—the most wretched night which, with
all her troubles, poor Berty had ever known.</p>

<p>Towards morning she fell into an uneasy
slumber, and dreamed that the strange gentleman,
in a policeman’s dress, with the
cheery smile still upon his face, hunted her
up and down through crowded streets and
lonely alleys, while Tim and all the people
cried “Stop thief!” and woke to find it morning,
and Lieb calling her to get up and
asking again those weary questions about
the basket and the broom.</p>

<p>She put him off with a story of Tim’s taking
care of them, gave him his breakfast, and
sent him away to his work; then dressed
little Fritz, and, leaving Lina and Rose to
take care of him and put the room to rights,
started out, with not much notion where she
was going,—only somewhere to get away
from herself. Tim was waiting for her at
the bottom of the stairs, with his new basket
full of apples in one hand, and his own old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
rag-basket and broom in the other. The
faithful little sentinel had waked with the
first peep of day, and gone out to the earliest
market-stall to purchase his little store before
Berty was stirring.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Berty,” said he, pleasantly.
“You left your basket and broom in the
street yesterday. I forgot all about it till just
now; and they’re quite gone before this. You
can take mine, though. I sha’n’t want ’em
any more, you know.”</p>

<p>Berty nodded, and took them without
speaking. It seemed that she scarcely needed
such tools now, rich as she was; but she
should feel lost without them, and they might
help to occupy her mind until she had decided
what to do with all that money. So
she set off for the crossing, while Tim followed
close at her heels, very uncomfortable,
but quite determined to keep her in sight.
He had gotten no farther through his puzzle,
poor boy, than this first determination; and
this playing the policeman upon Berty was
not at all to his taste.</p>

<p>And Berty liked it as little as he; for more
than anything else she dreaded to meet those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
eyes, the only ones which had seen her
hidden treasure,—more than anything else
she wished to avoid a talk with their owner,
the only person in all New York who knew
her uncomfortable secret. She thought perhaps
he would leave her at the crossing, and
go on to the ferry if she took no notice; so
she began to hunt very carefully among the
rubbish in the gutter, as if she had eyes and
thoughts for nothing else; but she could not
help looking round slyly at last, and there
was Tim posted at the corner with his
basket, though there could be very little
chance for customers among the few early
passers-by. Presently, when the crowd began
to thicken, she began to sweep the crossing
with her back towards the sidewalk; but,
ever and anon, as she glanced over her
shoulder, she would catch sight, between the
flitting figures, of her little policeman, never
looking for customers at all, never speaking,
never coming nearer, but watching, watching
still.</p>

<p>It was very provoking. What could Tim
mean by it? She would not have him watching
there; she would send him away. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
if she once spoke to him, what might he not
say to her? what might he not do? It was
a new feeling, this being afraid of Tim, and
not by any means a pleasant one; but one
thing was certain: she could never come
to any decision,—she could never do anything
with the money while Tim was watching
there. Berty was just thinking of running
away herself, when a stage stopped at the
crossing directly in front of her, and out
stepped the pleasant-looking gentleman, with
the old cheery smile upon his face. That
decided her; she dropped her broom in a
twinkling, and scampered away up the street.</p>

<p>On and on she ran, passing through street
after street, turning corner after corner, till at
last, quite breathless and spent, she ventured
to look behind, and seeing she was not pursued,
took courage to slacken her pace. Still
she dared not go back to the crossing; she
was even afraid to return to Mrs. Flanagan’s,
lest the gentleman should be seeking her
there; and so she wandered on, the streets
growing less and less familiar, till she had
lost her way entirely, and then sat down,
quite wearied out, upon the curb-stone, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
rest herself a little and determine what to
do. It was a handsome street, clean, and
well paved, and lined with stately brownstone
houses, not at all like any part of
the city where Berty had ever been before.
Though it was nearly noon, the people on
the sidewalks were few and far between,
and, but for the stages and the handsome
carriages, the street would have seemed very
lonely and quiet. Berty thought to herself
it could not be a very good place for the rag-pickers
and the crossing-sweepers. But who
was that skulking behind the area railing
yonder, and peeping out at her? Berty
started up in alarm, but she was too tired
to run away now; and, after all, it was only
Tim. Tim could not do her any great harm;
upon the whole, she would be rather glad
to see him than otherwise, for he would know
the way home. So she sat down again and
waited for him to come.</p>

<p>But Tim did not come. He stayed behind
the railing, only peeping out now and then
to make sure that his charge did not steal
away unperceived. He had taken it for
granted that Berty was running away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
him, for he knew nothing about the strange
gentleman; and so he had been skulking
behind things and people all the way up in
such a sly fashion that any one who noticed
him at all must have taken him, poor honest
fellow, for the culprit, instead of Berty.</p>

<p>Berty waited, as I said, and wondered;
and when she found Tim was not coming
to her, plucked up courage at last to go to
him. Tim could scarcely believe his eyes;
but he did not run away from Berty, you
may be sure. He made room for her upon
the stone step beside him, and received her
with a very pleasant smile.</p>

<p>“What made you run away, Berty?” said
he. “Sure, you knew I’d never harm you.”</p>

<p>Berty was very glad Tim had put this
construction upon her flight, for she dreaded,
of all things, letting him know about the
gentleman. “What made you watch me
so, then, Tim?” said she.</p>

<p>Tim was not quite prepared with an answer
to this question, so, in true Irish fashion,
he turned it off with a joke. “A cat may look
at a king, Berty,” he answered; “and you’re
no better than a king, sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“And you’re no better than a cat, Tim,”
answered Berty, sharply. “You looked just
like one, I’m sure. But I don’t want to talk
about that now,” she added, decidedly; “and
if you begin, I shall run away. I want you
to show me the way home.”</p>

<p>“You’re too tired to go home now, Berty,”
said Tim, with a pitying glance at the pale,
anxious face. “Sit down here, and rest a
bit, and eat an apple. You’re hungry, I’m
sure. I’ll never say a word you don’t like,
honey,—see if I do.”</p>

<p>Berty <em>was</em> very tired, and not a little
hungry; so, having confidence in Tim’s
promise, she sat down beside him; while
Tim, having made up his mind that his best
chance of influencing her was by removing
her fear of him, set himself to entertain her
to the best of his ability.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Berty</span> would scarcely have sat
there so securely, though, if she
had known who was making
his way, through all the downtown
maze, towards the very
house in front of which she and Tim had
settled themselves.</p>

<p>Perhaps my young readers have not forgotten
the aunt Emily of whom little Mary
spoke in a former chapter. This house belonged
to that very aunt Emily; and the
fine carriage, with the handsome bay horses,
which was drawn up in front of the door,
and upon the merits of which Tim was expatiating,
belonged to Mrs. Grey, who, with
her little grand-daughter, was making a morning
visit to aunt Emily.</p>

<p>While the old ladies were gossiping together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
little Mary sat by the window watching
the passing stages, and looking out for
Dr. John, who had promised to return that
way when his business down town was finished,
and take them with him to visit a
hospital where some of the patients were
under his care. When Berty and Tim came
and sat down in front of the gate, Mary
turned her attention a little from the stages
and began watching them.</p>

<p>Berty’s pale face and weary look soon
interested her very much; for, ever since
that talk with cousin John she had been
looking out for some one whom she could
help. Here was, perhaps, the very case
she wanted, for these children were certainly
poor enough, and the little girl especially
looked very sad; but how could
she begin? Just then, aunt Emily, whose
only notion of entertaining children seemed
to consist in feeding them, ordered a plate
of cakes brought in for Mary to eat. Mary
was not at all hungry, so she only broke off
a little corner of one, not to seem rude, and
set the plate upon the window-seat. Then
it occurred to her that perhaps the little girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
was hungry and might like some of the
cakes. At least it would give her a good
excuse for talking a little.</p>

<p>“Aunt Emily,” said she, “there is a little
girl and boy out here by the steps, and they
look hungry. May I give them some of my
cakes?”</p>

<p>“If there are more than you want, my
dear,” answered the old lady; “but mind
and don’t go very near them, Polly, or you
may catch some disease.”</p>

<p>Very glad of this permission, Mary took
the plate of cakes in her hand and went out
upon the steps. Hearing the door close,
Tim and Berty looked round, and seeing
the little girl coming down the steps, supposed
she was coming out of the gate, and
rose to go away.</p>

<p>“Don’t go away, please,” said Mary.
“I was only coming to bring you some
cakes. My aunty gave me some, and there
were more than I wanted, so I brought some
out for you. Wouldn’t you like some?”
And she held the plate out to them over
the little iron gate.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/80.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">BERTY, TIM, AND MARY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The cakes looked very inviting, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>little girl’s manner was so courteous that
it would have seemed quite uncivil to refuse;
so Tim made his best bow, and Berty
dropped a courtesy, while each took a cake.</p>

<p>“Oh, take more, take them all; I meant
them all for you,” said Mary, still holding
out the plate. “If there are too many to
eat now, you can put them in your pockets
and take them home.”</p>

<p>“Take them, Berty,” said Tim, “since the
little Miss is so kind. I can put them in my
basket for you, and the childer will be glad
of them; they don’t get such every day, ye
know.”</p>

<p>“So you have some brothers and sisters?”
said Mary, after the plate was emptied and
the contents stowed in Tim’s basket. “How
many?”</p>

<p>“There are four younger than me, Miss,”
answered Berty: “two boys and two girls.”</p>

<p>“And I have two,—a brother and sister.
Mine are twins. Are any of yours twins?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss; we all come in a row. Mother
said we are like little steps,” said Berty.</p>

<p>“You have a mother, then. My father
and mother are dead; there are only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
babies and I,” said little Mary, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Are they?” cried Berty, drawing nearer
to Mary with a shy feeling of sympathy.
“So are mine, too; and there are only the
children and me, except uncle Gottlieb in
the old country; and we cannot hear from
him since mother died.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Mary, in amazement.
“Have you nobody to take care of you?
no grandmother, or cousin, or aunt?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss; we have only each other.”</p>

<p>“But who feeds you, then? Who buys
your clothes for you?”</p>

<p>“We have not much, Miss,” said Berty,
simply. “But what we have we get ourselves,
my brother and I; the others are
too little.”</p>

<p>“But how can you?” cried Mary, utterly
unable to understand such destitution.
“You are too little to work yourself, and
your brother,” glancing at Tim, “is not very
big. How can you take care of so many?”</p>

<p>“We pick things from the gutters, Miss,”
said Berty, “and sometimes we sweep the
crossing; and Mrs. Flanagan forgives us the
rent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it is very sad!” cried Mary, clasping
her hands; “it is much worse than us.
Cousin John said there were others much
worse off than I, but I did not see how it
could be. He said I could help them. Can
I help you? I have not any money here,
but I have some at home. Will you come
there and let me give you some? I should
like so much to help you if I might.”</p>

<p>Berty scarcely knew how to answer these
eager questions, so unexpected and so kind.
What answer she would have made I cannot
tell; for, while she was considering, a
stage stopped in front of the gate, and Mary
called out eagerly, “There is cousin John!
Oh, cousin John! have you found the pocket-book?
have you some money with you?
Here is a little girl who has no father or
mother, and I want—”</p>

<p>Little Mary never finished her sentence,
for Berty heard that word “pocket-book,”
saw and recognized the strange gentleman
getting out of the stage, and, putting both
hands to her bosom, darted, with a wild cry
of terror, out into the street. Tim dropped
his basket and sprang after her; but he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
too late,—the stage-horses, frightened by
the cry, had started on, trampling poor
Berty under their feet.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s confusion, little
Mary and the stage-passengers screaming,
and Tim, the Doctor, and Mrs. Grey’s coachman
all springing to the horses’ heads
while a little crowd of people gathered
round. Then Dr. John pushed his way
through it, bearing Berty in his arms, bleeding,
bruised, and quite insensible.</p>

<p>“Don’t bring her in here, John! pray
don’t!” called out aunt Emily from the
window,—to which she and Mrs. Grey had
been attracted by Mary’s cries,—as she saw
the young Doctor turning towards the steps.
“She’ll die, or there’ll have to be some operation,
and I never could bear it in the world.
Don’t bring her here.”</p>

<p>Dr. John made an impatient gesture,
and looked appealingly towards Mrs. Grey:
“Shall I take her home, grandmother?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, John,” said the good lady, “if
you do not think it too far. She is not
dead?”</p>

<p>“No; only fainted,” said the Doctor, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
shockingly hurt. Bring me out some hartshorn,
and lend me your handkerchiefs, some
of you,” added he, bearing the child towards
the carriage.</p>

<p>“Cousin John,” said Mary, pushing her
way through the crowd, “why don’t you
take her to the hospital? It is so much
nearer, and you were going there, you
know.”</p>

<p>“The very thing. You have more sense
than any of us, Polly,” cried the Doctor,
springing into the carriage with Berty still
in his arms. “Drive to the hospital, Tom,
carefully, but as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“And her brother,—here’s her brother.
Pray, let him go with you, cousin,” said
Mary, pushing poor, frightened, anxious Tim
towards the carriage-door.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Jump in, my little fellow,”
said the Doctor, kindly.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Berty came to herself, she
was lying on a bed, and the
strange gentleman was bending
over her, with a very anxious
expression upon his pleasant
face. Her first impulse was to try running
away once more, but she found she had
not strength enough to lift her head from the
pillow. Then she became conscious that
there was a bandage round her temples, and
that a kind-looking lady was beside the gentleman,
helping him to unfasten her dress.
“They’ll find the pocket-book now,” thought
she, and she tried to put up her hands to
shield it; but the right one was strangely
powerless, and the left one the gentleman
held in his, while he felt her pulse. When
the lady came to the pocket-book, which
she presently did to Berty’s great distress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
she took it in her hand, and squeezing it
a little, handed it to the gentleman, saying,
“I don’t know what it is.” It was no
wonder she did not know, for Berty had
wrapped it carefully in several papers, and
tied it with a piece of string before she left
home that morning.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the gentleman, passing
it to Tim, who, Berty now saw for the
first time, was standing at the foot of the
bed. “Never mind, Madam; only make
haste, and cut the sleeve from the right
arm there. I suspect it is broken.”</p>

<p>Berty thought it very strange that the
gentleman should not know his own pocket-book
when he held it in his hand; but she
was so frightened at the thought of her
broken arm that she could scarcely feel
relieved at her escape. The sleeve was soon
cut away, and the gentleman lifted the
wounded arm gently, and felt it tenderly
here and there. The pain caused by the
motion was so great that Berty could scarcely
help crying out with it; but she made a
great effort, and kept still.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dr. John at length,—of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
my young readers have guessed that Dr.
John and the strange gentleman were one
and the same person,—“yes, it is as I feared:
the shoulder is dislocated, and the forearm
broken.”</p>

<p>Tim gave a pitying exclamation, and Berty
a little frightened cry.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, my dear,” said the Doctor.
“It is not so very bad. If you are only
brave and patient, we can put it all right again
directly; and after that we shall take such
good care of you that you will be quite sorry
when you are well enough to go away. All
our little people are sorry when their time
comes to leave us; are they not, Mrs. Gantz?”</p>

<p>“But the children,” cried Berty, in dismay,—“what
will become of the children?”</p>

<p>“Sure, ye know I’ll not let them suffer,
Berty,” said Tim. “Never you worry for
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll take care of the children,” said
the Doctor. “Never fear for them. Now,
Berty, see how still you can lie; and you,
Madam, keep hold of this hand while I feel
of that poor shoulder again;” and, with a
single dexterous motion, Dr. John brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the bone back to its wonted place. Berty
had been too much taken by surprise to cry
out at first, and when it was over she felt too
faint even to groan.</p>

<p>“You are a brave little girl,” said the Doctor,
wiping the pale face tenderly and holding
a glass of water to Berty’s lips. “The
worst is over; it is only to dress the arm now
and attend to one or two other little matters.
My boy,” turning to Tim, “you may go
down to the carriage,—I think Tom is back
by this time,—and tell him to drive home
with you, and ask Mrs. Grey to put up a
good basket of provisions. By the time you
are back again I shall be ready to go with
you.”</p>

<p>Tim telegraphed, in answer to Berty’s imploring
look, that he would take care of the
pocket-book, and would not betray her; for
Tim, it must be remembered, had not the
slightest notion to whom it belonged, not
having noticed little Mary’s question, and he
would not, for the world, have exposed Berty
to the risk of going to the Tombs by taking
it to the station-house now: and yet the honest
boy could not help feeling almost guilty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
as he put the package in his pocket and
went down to the carriage.</p>

<p>“Now we are rid of the boy,” said Dr.
John, who had been all the time busily at
work putting splints and bandages upon the
broken arm,—“now we are rid of the boy,
we’ll attend to that bruise on the side and
the sprained ankle; and then I think you
can change her clothing a little, perhaps.
Does your arm feel better now, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Much better,” answered Berty, faintly;
“but oh, my side!”</p>

<p>The side was, indeed, the worst injury, for
the horse’s hoof had struck there, tearing
off the skin and inflicting a frightful bruise.
The Doctor feared at first that a rib was
broken, but finally concluding it was not, he
dressed the wound carefully and bandaged
the sprained ankle. Then the good nurse
put on a little white night-gown in place of
the soiled and torn dress; and, by the time
Tim came back, Berty was much more comfortable,
though still very faint and in great
pain.</p>

<p>“Your sister is a right brave little girl,”
said Dr. John, as Tim came to the bedside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
“I never had a grown-up patient who behaved
better.”</p>

<p>“Berty’s not one of the whining sort,”
Tim answered; “but, sir, she’s not my sister
at all.”</p>

<p>“Ah! is she not? I thought you were
very unlike,” said Dr. John, glancing from
one to the other.</p>

<p>“She’s Dutch and I’m Irish, sir; but we
live in the same house.”</p>

<p>“Fellow-lodgers, eh? That explains it.
But about these children, now. How many
are there?”</p>

<p>“Four, sir,” answered Tim.</p>

<p>“And you don’t mean to say,” said the
Doctor, turning to Berty, “that there is no
one who takes care of them but you?”</p>

<p>“Lieb helps me,” answered Berty, faintly,
turning her face away from Dr. John’s compassionate
gaze. Berty did not much like
talking to, or looking at, the Doctor, kind as
he was, and pleasant as he looked, for the
pocket-book somehow would come between.</p>

<p>“Who is Lieb?” asked Dr. John, turning
again to Tim.</p>

<p>“He is her brother, sir; but he’s younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
than she, and they’ve no one else. The father
died at sea, and the mother wint afther
him last spring, sir. It’s very hard upon
Berty, sir, feeding so many little mouths,
and she’ll not let me help her, though I’ve
tried, many a time and oft.”</p>

<p>“Hard enough, indeed,” said Dr. John,
exchanging a glance of surprise and pity
with the nurse; “but she can’t help herself
now, my lad; so you and I will take care of
them in spite of her. You are faint and
tired, my dear,” he added, turning to Berty;
“but all you have to do now is to rest and
get well. I would go to sleep directly, if I
were you. We’ll look after the children,
this young gentleman and I; and I promise
you they shall not want for anything. I
will see you again to-morrow. Good night,
now, and God bless you.”</p>

<p>Berty could only murmur a faint “Thank
you,” in answer to all this kindness; for the
pocket-book loomed up very big by this time,
I can tell you. When the Doctor and Tim
were gone, and the nurse, after smoothing
the bedclothes and arranging the pillows very
comfortably, went off to attend to her other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
patients, Berty tried to think the matter over
and decide what to do; but she was much
too faint and tired for such weary work, and
soon, in spite of her efforts, obeyed the Doctor’s
parting injunction, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Great was the amazement at Mrs. Flanagan’s
when the grand carriage drove up, and
Dr. John and Tim got out; and dire were
the lamentations of Berty’s little family
when informed of the accident. But Tim’s
glowing account of the comforts of the hospital
and the kindness of the Doctor and the
nurse went far to console them; and Mrs.
Grey’s famous basket of provisions, too,
was a great help: for these poor little children
seldom tasted anything really good;
and even Gottlieb and Lina, who were the
only ones old enough to appreciate their sister’s
misfortune, could not help heartily enjoying
the wholesome food.</p>

<p>Fritzy cried a little for his Berty when bedtime
came, but Lina managed to soothe him;
and, for the rest, the Doctor’s pleasant face
had so won their hearts that they were quite
ready to credit Tim’s assurance that both
they and Berty would be safe under his care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>Tim did not sleep at the foot of the stairs
again, but spread his straw pallet at the
head of them, close to the children’s door, in
spite of uncle Teddy’s remonstrance. He
did not mind the hard bed in the least; but
the pocket-book pricked so, through the thin
pillow under which it was laid for safe-keeping,
that Tim resolved to bring Berty to terms
on the morrow, or never to take charge of it
again.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Dr. John</span> was met at the door
on his return by little Mary
who had been sitting at the
window an hour or more,
watching for him to come.
She had worked off a little of her enthusiasm
in packing the basket of provisions, but
was still full of eager curiosity and sympathy.
Grandmamma, too, was very anxious
to hear more of the little sufferer at
the hospital, and the helpless children of
whom little Mary had told her. So Dr. John
was obliged to go over the whole story of
Berty’s injuries, and her patient endurance
of the painful operation and dressing,—of
her anxiety for her little ones,—of Tim’s
touching account of the helpless family, given
during their drive,—and, last of all, he was
made to describe Mrs. Flanagan’s house, and
the room in the attic, and the poor little
orphans themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“But there is one thing,” said Dr. John
when he had finished his story, and answered
every question Mary could think of,—“there
is one thing for which I cannot account. The
child was talking to you, Polly, when the
stage stopped; was she not? What could
have possessed her to dart into the street in
such a frantic way, I cannot tell; and the
boy seemed quite as much at a loss to account
for it as I. What were you saying to
her, Polly?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember,” answered Mary,
thoughtfully,—“Oh, yes, I do, too! She had
been telling me about the children, you know,
and I offered to help her, and then I remembered
that I hadn’t my purse; and then I
saw you, and I asked if you had found your
pocket-book, because I wanted to borrow
some money; and then she ran. I know
now I thought it was because she didn’t
want to take it; and then came the accident
and put everything out of my head.”</p>

<p>“But about the pocket-book, John,” said
Mrs. Grey, “I have not heard you say. Did
you find it, or get any trace of it?”</p>

<p>“Not the least. I sent an advertisement to
the ‘Herald’ and another to the ‘Times,’ and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
stopped the drafts at the bank, and left the
description, with the numbers of the checks
and a few of the larger notes, at the police-office.
I don’t see that I can do any more.
It is a large sum, more than I can well afford
to lose; but if it is gone I cannot help
it. So you need not look so doleful, Polly. I
shall get along without it somehow.”</p>

<p>“If you would only let me give you some
of mine, cousin John. I have so much more
than I know what to do with.”</p>

<p>“Have you? Well, I shall know where
to come, then, when I get hard up.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t lend him any, if I were you,
Polly,” said Mrs. Grey, smiling. “He’ll be
sure to lose it, such a careless fellow. I
always told you what would come of it,
John, sticking your purse in such out-of-the-way
places.”</p>

<p>“It was in my breeches-pocket this time,
Grandma,—just where you taught me to
keep it when I was a boy.”</p>

<p>“As if you were anything else now!” said
Mrs. Grey, shaking her head at him; “and
I don’t believe you know in the least where
it was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” insisted Dr. John, “because I
remember it was in the way when I wanted
a dime from the bottom of that same pocket
for a poor little girl at the crossing, and I
took it out—”</p>

<p>“And never put it back again,” interrupted
his grandmother. “There, I knew just how it
was. You’re not fit to be trusted with a
purse at all. You must leave it at home
next time with Polly and I. We know better
than to lay a stuffed pocket-book down
upon a stage-seat, as if it was a paper
parcel.”</p>

<p>Dr. John appeared to pay very little attention
to the old lady’s raillery. He was thinking
too intently,—trying to remember something,
if one might judge by his knitted
brows. “Yes,” he said, at length, as if he
had gotten at it at last,—“yes; I am sure
of it. The child at the crossing and this little
Berty are the same. I thought I had seen
her somewhere. And what is more,” he
added, interrupting Mary’s wondering exclamation,—“what
is more, I saw her again at
that same crossing when I went down town
this morning; and I was feeling for a dime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
when she dropped her broom and ran off up
the street as if the sight of me had frightened
her out of her wits. Look at me,
Polly. Am I so very ugly? Do I look like
an ogre to frighten little girls?”</p>

<p>“You are not a bit like an ogre, cousin
John,” said Polly, patting lovingly the
comely face, which bent down to hers.
“You are very handsome, and you know
it. Nobody could be frightened at you,
and I’m sure Berty wasn’t; but it is very
strange.”</p>

<p>“It is more than strange,” said Mrs. Grey,
thoughtfully. “I don’t like the look of it at
all. Is it possible, John, that the child has
your purse?”</p>

<p>“My purse!” cried Dr. John, astonished.
“Surely not; how can you think so?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Grandmamma!” said Polly, indignantly;
“that good, poor, innocent little Berty!
How can you say such cruel things?”</p>

<p>“Think a moment, John,” pursued the old
lady, giving little heed to Mary’s remonstrance.
“You are certain you have not
seen it since you took it out to give this child
the dime?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“I certainly have not. I missed it when I
put my hand in again to get my fare.”</p>

<p>“And you are sure you had it then?”</p>

<p>“As certain as I can be of anything; for I
remember thinking how much trouble you
gave me by insisting upon my keeping it
in such an inconvenient place.”</p>

<p>“And this child has run away from you
twice now in the most unaccountable manner,”
the old lady went on; “and if it had
been all right, after getting a dime from you
once, she would have been certain to wait
for another. It is not like these street-children,
whatever Polly may think, to refuse
what is offered to them. It is very sad. I
am quite as unwilling to believe it as Mary
can be; but, if you are certain you had it,
and there were no pickpockets in the car, I’m
afraid this little Berty knows something about
the pocket-book. John, I’m very much afraid
it’s not all right.”</p>

<p>Dr. John started out of another fit of musing
as his grandmother ceased speaking, and
glanced at Mary, who was by this time
weeping bitterly over what seemed to her
these cruel suspicions of her little favorite.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
“Well, Grandma,” said he, with a meaning
look at the old lady, “I can’t be at all sure
about the pickpockets. I may have had one
for my next neighbor, for aught I know; or I
may have laid the purse down on the seat, as
you said. It would be just like me, I dare
say; so we won’t suspect anybody,—we’ll
wait and see; and meantime we’ll put the
whole matter out of our heads.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t think it’s Berty, cousin
John?” said Mary, drying her tears; “so I
may use some of my money for her and for
the little ones, and I may hope it is like doing
it for Him?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Polly; how can you doubt it?”</p>

<p>“I was afraid,” said Polly, timidly, “if
Berty was a thief, you know she would not
be one of his brethren. Do you think it
would be the same?”</p>

<p>“Just the same, if it is done for his sake.”</p>

<p>“Then, cousin John, will you tell me how
to help them most?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you can do much for Berty
now,” said Dr. John; “you will have to leave
her to the tender mercy of Mrs. Gantz and
myself; but those little people down there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
are sadly in need of clothing. They are
the oddest-looking little mortals; the girls’
dresses are like patchwork quilts, and as for
the boy,—well, I shouldn’t care to have
Berty for my tailor, poor child. I think the
best thing you can do is to get Grandma to
go with you there in the morning, and find
out what they need. I dare say you’ll get
rid of all your superfluous cash. I shouldn’t
wonder if you had none left by the time I
come to want, and then we shall both have
to fall back upon Grandma.”</p>

<p>So Polly soon lost the sad suspicions in a
vision of coats and frocks and shoes; but
Dr. John, through all his kind plans, was tormented
by an uncomfortable remembrance
of that little package which Mrs. Gantz had
taken from Berty’s bosom, and of the telegram
which had passed between his little
patient and Tim. I say uncomfortable;
for, though Dr. John would have been very
glad to find his purse, he would rather have
found it anywhere else than in Berty’s or
Tim’s possession.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> morning sunshine streamed
through the lofty windows of
the children’s ward, lighting up
cheerfully the snowy beds and
the pale faces of their little occupants,
and waking Berty from her feverish,
uneasy slumber. She was puzzled at first
by the unfamiliar objects around; but the
bandage on her forehead, with the powerless
arm and aching side, brought back
the remembrance of the accident, even before
the kind nurse appeared with her cheerful,
motherly face and pleasant greeting.
This good lady’s watchful attentions, the
morning bath so tenderly administered, the
delicate invalid breakfast so invitingly spread
upon the little tray, and the bright room
where even suffering was made to look so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
cheerful and comely, were all so new and
so delightful, that Berty thought it almost a
privilege to be ill in such a place.</p>

<p>Afterwards, too, when breakfast was over,
and the nurse propped her up with pillows,
and left her to attend to other duties, Berty
was very happy, though her arm and side
were still very painful. She thought she
could never tire of looking at the beautiful
prints upon the walls, nor of watching and
listening to her young companions, who
seemed to be quite at home, and called to
each other, from bed to bed, as merrily as
any well children could do. But presently
some one spoke of the Doctor, hoping he
would come early; and, at the mention of
that name, all Berty’s joy and contentment
melted away in a moment, and she sank
back upon her pillow, with a look of care and
weariness upon her face which made all the
children pity her very much indeed.</p>

<p>The old tormenting question, What to do,
had come back again, and it seemed to Berty
more troublesome than ever before. The
Doctor had been so kind, both to her and
to her little ones,—how could she bear to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
do him such injury as to keep his property?
But he evidently knew nothing about her
possessing it,—he had held it in his hand
without seeming to have the least suspicion;
and now she was ill she had no chance of
earning anything: she could never accomplish
her design in any other way.</p>

<p>Just in the midst of these painful thoughts,
the nurse came in ushering Tim to pay her
his morning visit. Tim had left home with
the firm determination to make Berty do the
right thing about the pocket-book, or else
refuse to have anything more to do with it;
but, remembering her strange conduct about
it from the first, he was a little shy about
beginning. So he sat down by the bed, and
gave Berty a long and glowing account of
the Doctor’s kindness to the children, and the
great fancy they had taken to him,—a very
good way of beginning, if Tim had only
known it. After he had spun this subject
out as long as he could, and answered all
Berty’s questions about little Fritz, he came
to a dead stop for a moment, and was just
mustering courage to commence his lecture,
when a strain of sweet music floating in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
seemed to fill all the hall with a cheerful
solemnity.</p>

<p>“What is it, Tim?” asked Berty, after
listening a moment.</p>

<p>“It’s the organ, I think,” answered Tim.</p>

<p>“The organ! Where?”</p>

<p>“Why, in the chapel, sure; don’t ye know,
Berty, there’s a chapel here, a little church
like, right in the middle of the building?
All the halls open into it; and it’s beautiful,
I tell you.”</p>

<p>“But it’s not Sunday, Tim.”</p>

<p>“No; but I think they has service every
day,—leastways, I saw the people sitting
there whin I wint out last night, waiting
like. But it’s a feast to-day, Berty; it’s
All-Saints, ye know,—the first of November.
Belike they’d have service to-day, if
ever. I was to go to Mass meself but for
you; thin I put it off till Vespers,” answered
devout Tim.</p>

<p>“All-Saints,” said Berty, thoughtfully.
“Ah, yes, I know,—<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Fest Allerheiligen</i>:
they keep it in my country, too. Mother
took us to <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Kirche</i> last year, because of
father, and now she is with him in <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das Paradies</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
I <em>meant</em> to remember them to-day;
I’m so glad this puts me in mind.”</p>

<p>The music ceased, and a nurse, watching
her patient near, held up a warning finger.
There was a moment’s silence, Tim bending
his head reverently, and Berty closing her
eyes, the only outward sign of which she
was capable; then the service began. “If
we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us; but if we
confess our sins, God is faithful and just to
forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from
all unrighteousness.” A strange beginning,
perhaps, for a service in commemoration of
the saints departed; but very well suited,
assuredly, to make saints of those who were
left behind. Perhaps the good clergyman
had some such case as Berty’s in his mind;
certainly, he could have chosen no sentence
which would have fixed her attention more
securely.</p>

<p>The beautiful ritual which followed was
quite unfamiliar to both Tim and Berty,
the one being a Lutheran, and the other a
Papist; but the slow, distinct utterance of
the minister rendered every word perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
audible, and the solemn confession of sin is
fitted for all who have named the name
of Christ. When it came to the Lord’s
Prayer, all the children joined. Tim, recognizing
the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Paternoster</i>, fell upon his knees;
and Berty, lifting her well hand in supplication,
repeated her <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vaterunser</i> with the
rest.</p>

<p>As the service went on with Psalm, and
Lesson, and Collect, Tim noticed that the
children seemed to consider themselves quite
a part of the congregation, joining in the
responses, and singing with a hearty zeal
which pleased him very much; but as for
Berty, though she still lay with her eyes
closed and her hand raised, her mind had
wandered far away from the scene, around
the dear ones she had lost. She tried to
recall her father’s dying words, her mother’s
parting counsel. She wondered in her troubled
heart whether they could still look down
upon their child,—whether they could know
her uncomfortable secret. Then she thought
of the Doctor again, and of his kindness to
the little ones. Ah, if her mother knew it,
how grateful she would be, how she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
think nothing too much to do for her children’s
friend. What <em>would</em> she say, how
<em>would</em> she feel, if she knew how her daughter
proposed to requite him?</p>

<p>But, all at once, as the notes of a hymn
died away and the clergyman’s voice was
heard again, it seemed to Berty that it took
a more stern and solemn tone. She could
not help listening, and, while she listened, the
words seemed to carry her straight into the
presence of Him “to whom all hearts are
open, all desires known, and from whom
no secrets are hid.” She had thought of her
mother, and of the Doctor, and wondered
what they would think <em>if</em> they knew; but
here was One who <em>did</em> know, from whom
she could not hide her secret if she would.
What did He think? How would her “desires”
bear His inspection?</p>

<p>Berty trembled with terror as she asked
herself this question, and, even as she asked
it, the answer came; for the solemn voice
went on to the rehearsal of the familiar
Commandments which she had learned at
her mother’s knee; while, at the end of
each one, the response swelled up from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
chapel,—“Lord, have mercy upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law.” Berty
held her breath as if waiting for a blow; and
at last it came, in that stern, solemn voice,—<em>“Thou
shalt</em> <span class="allsmcap">NOT</span> <em>steal</em>.” Tim, too, had been
waiting for this, and his voice joined in the
response, “Lord, have mercy upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law,” with a
startling emphasis, which went to Berty’s
heart; then, almost before the words had
left his lips, he leaned forward and whispered
earnestly, “Say it, Berty,—say it for your
life.” It seemed to Berty almost as if her
life did hang for a moment in the balance,—only
a moment though, for she could not
hesitate. She raised her hand again, and
murmured the petition so faintly that Tim
could scarcely hear. Another heard, and
answered it, as we shall presently see; and
Tim heard, too, and gave thanks upon his
knees that his Berty was saved.</p>

<p>“Now, Berty,” said he, rising when the
service was ended, and taking the package
from his pocket,—“now, Berty, you know
what I’m going to do,—take this to the station
right off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“To the station! What for, Tim? Of
course that would be easier; but maybe they
wouldn’t find him; and then, Tim, don’t you
think he ought to know? It would be very
hard, to be sure, but don’t you think I ought
to tell him?”</p>

<p>“An’ who’s him, Berty?” asked Tim, quite
puzzled.</p>

<p>“The Doctor, of course. Oh, Tim, didn’t
you know it was the Doctor’s? That’s one
thing why I couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“The Docther’s! You don’t mane to tell
me now, Berty, that this pocket-book belongs
to the Docther?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tim; he gave me a dime there at
the crossing, and this dropped, and I ran
after the stage, but they didn’t notice me,
and then at first I meant to take it to the
station or something; but I thought of my
Christmas tree, and so—and so—I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, Berty,” said Tim, after a long,
thoughtful pause, “I’m glad I didn’t know
the rights of the matther till ye had come to
a betther mind, for I can’t say I think well
of it. So it’s running away from <em>him</em> ye
were, and no wonder; and he had it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
his own hand too, sure enough. Yes, it’s
well I didn’t know, for I should have given
it back to him straight, and it’ll look betther
coming from you.”</p>

<p>Berty quite agreed that it would look
better coming from her, and yet her heart
sank within her when she saw the Doctor’s
pleasant face appear at the door. He came
straight towards her bed, only nodding to
the other children as he passed them.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Berty,” said he; “how
do you find yourself to-day?”</p>

<p>Berty did not wait to answer. Her courage
was melting away so rapidly, that she
felt she had no time to lose. She took the
pocket-book from Tim and held it out to the
Doctor.</p>

<p>“Here it is. Oh, take it! take it, quick!”
said she, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>The Doctor took the package in his hand,
and stood looking from one to the other. He
had put his suspicions so entirely away that
they did not readily return.</p>

<p>“What is it, Tim?” said he, at last.</p>

<p>“It’s a pocket-book, sir, that Berty found.
She says it’s yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>The Doctor changed color then, and tearing
the cover away, examined the enclosure.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “it is mine. Where did
you get it?”</p>

<p>“Please count the money then, sir,” said
honest Tim, before Berty could command
her voice to answer. “I kept it for her last
night. I should like you to see if it’s all
right.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not give it to me then?”
asked Dr. John, sharply, opening the pocket-book,
and glancing rapidly over the contents.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” said Berty, finding her voice
instantly,—“Oh, sir, you must not blame
Tim; he did not know it was yours. I
never told him, and he was always at me to
find the owner. I meant to give it back at
first, and I should, but for the Christmas tree.
I wanted it so much, so very much, and I
could never earn enough. I’m very, very
sorry; but you must not blame Tim.”</p>

<p>“It is all right,” said Dr. John, nodding to
Tim, and putting the purse in his pocket.
“Now, Berty,” he added, soothingly, “you
must not cry any more; it is all right and
safe, and I’m very much obliged to you for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
bringing it back; it is not every one who
would have done it. Stop crying now, and
tell me how you got it, and about this
Christmas tree. I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“I wanted one for the children, sir,” said
Berty, composing her voice a little; “they
never saw one, you see, but I did; and
Madame Hansmann told them about those
in the old country. So I heard them one
night wishing for one,—only they said
they could not have it, because they had
no one but me. Then I wished so much
to get one, because I promised mother to
take such care of them; and I asked Biddy,
and she said they cost pounds and pounds;
and I did not believe quite in the fairy, so I
thought I must earn it; and I felt very bad,
and almost gave it up. Then I thought
about Jesus, and how mother said he would
be our friend; so I prayed, and I hoped he
would help me. Then, the very first day,
when you gave me a dime, the pocket-book
came tumbling down beside me, and I did
not know if it was yours; but I ran after
the stage, but nobody noticed; and then I
thought it might be sent because I prayed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
you know,—only, when I showed it to Tim
he said it was as bad as stealing. That made
me angry, and I would not speak to him;
but I was not happy with it at all when I
meant to keep it. Then in the morning I
saw you at the crossing, and I thought you
were looking for me, so I ran away; and,
while I was talking to the little girl, you
came again, so I got all wild like, and ran
into the street. Then you were so kind, I
did not know about keeping it last night,
only for the tree; but this morning I thought
of mother, because of the feast of All-Saints,
and the minister said the Commandments,
and I could not keep it any longer for the
children, or anybody,—don’t you see?”</p>

<p>I am not at all sure that Dr. John did see,
for I know that his eyes were full of tears
when Berty finished; but he seemed to understand
quite clearly for all that.</p>

<p>“Yes, Berty,” said he, “I see that you have
had a great temptation, and have won through
it bravely. And as for Tim here, I beg his
pardon; I perceive he is a very honest fellow.
But he must bid you good-morning
now, for I want to look at that side of
yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Tim felt a little disappointed that Dr. John
did not offer Berty something as a reward
for bringing back his money, for Tim could
not bear that the Christmas tree should be
given up after all; but still he had great confidence
in the Doctor, and did not doubt but
he would make it all right somehow. So
he went away to his peddling with a light
heart.</p>

<p>As for Berty, she thought she had never
felt so happy in her life, even though her
wounds were very painful, and the Christmas-tree
tapers had utterly gone out; for there
was something shining upon Berty which
lighted up her heart far more brightly than
any Christmas tapers ever could,—her Heavenly
Father’s smile. And the Doctor, too,
instead of being angry, seemed kinder than
ever. He dressed her side and ankle very
tenderly, and then sat down by the bed and
talked for a long time, asking many questions
about her family, and especially about the
uncle Gottlieb in the old country, of whom
little Mary had told him. Berty knew very
little about him, except that he was her
mother’s only brother,—that he lived in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Frankfort, and belonged to one of the bands
which she remembered with such delight as
playing at the concerts on the feast-days.
Madame Hansmann had written to him, it
seemed, after her mother’s death; but they
had never received any answer.</p>

<p>“Well, Polly,” said Dr. John, when he
went home that evening, “I have found my
pocket-book; and, what is more, I have got
hold of a famous plan for spending your surplus
money.”</p>

<p>“I have a plan, too, cousin John,” said
Polly; “but let us hear yours first.”</p>

<p>So the Doctor told Berty’s story, which you
will not care to hear for the third time; and
as for his famous plan, I mean to keep that
for a good ending to my story. Polly liked
it very much, and so I dare say will you;
but she could not give up her own, and so
it was decided that both should be carried
out.</p>

<p>“I am glad,” said Polly, when all was
finally arranged,—“I am glad, cousin John,
that you found your pocket-book, for I should
not wonder if you had to lend me some
money, after all;” and Dr. John thought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
himself, as he looked down at the little girl’s
glowing, happy face, that any amount of
money would have been well spent in working
such a change as these kind schemes
had made in his sad, little cousin.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Mary’s</span> plan, which developed
itself the next day, turned out
to be a project for taking the
children, in their new clothes, to
visit their sister at the hospital.
She had stipulated that nothing should be
said to Berty, though she had taken care to
give Tim warning that he might be on hand
to enjoy the surprise. It was a beautiful,
bright autumn day, and everything worked
to Mary’s satisfaction. Grandmamma seemed
to enjoy it as much as she; and even Tom,
who had grumbled a good deal at bringing
his horses so often into such “ojus” streets,
could not resist a contagious grin as he
lifted the happy children, one by one, into
the carriage.</p>

<p>It was indeed a wonderful delight to
Berty’s little family. Driving through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
gay streets, where Mrs. Grey took care that
Tom should go, in the handsome, easy carriage,
would have been pleasure enough, but
going in such a way to see Berty, whom they
had missed so much, was almost more than
they could bear. Then the wide lawn of the
hospital, where the little pale children were
playing in the sunshine, was a new surprise;
and the children’s ward, with its lofty walls
and little white beds, in one of which sister
Berty lay, looking so placid and happy,
seemed like a glimpse of paradise.</p>

<p>You will guess, of course, how joyfully
Berty received them; how she hugged little
Fritz with her one arm, and set him on the
bed beside her, while she made the others
stand off, one by one, that she might admire
them in the comfortable new clothing; how
she thanked Mrs. Grey and the Doctor and
Mary; how Tim grinned from ear to ear,
and Dr. John rubbed his hands, and Polly
clapped hers, and the nurse and old Mrs.
Grey both cried, and the hospital children
sat up in bed and laughed at the merry
hubbub, until the matron came up and
chided them all for making such a noise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
and threatened Dr. John with a policeman if
he did not keep his party quiet.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a happy time; and happy, too,
though in a different way, was the long quiet
time which followed, when, under the Doctor’s
kind care, Berty was growing better and
stronger every day, and learning every day
to love more and more dearly the pleasant
room, the lively prints upon the walls, the
happy little sick children, the gentle nurses,
the good rector who stopped to talk with
her so often, and the dear, dear Dr. John, to
whom she owed it all.</p>

<p>The Christmas-time to which she had
looked forward in her dreary attic on that
dismal night—how far away the attic
seemed, how long ago the night—was
drawing near, was close at hand. Tim told
her of the laurel-wreaths which they were
hanging in the chapel. Her dearest wish
was to get strong enough to go down there
with Tim and keep the Christmas feast,
and afterwards, perhaps, to have the children
come to her again. It would be treat enough
for them, she knew, and joy enough for her;
but when she asked the Doctor, she got no
answer but a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>The Doctor was so busy nowadays, perhaps
he had no time for anything but smiles.
And very busy, too, was little Mary; it was
wonderful what a deal of shopping those two
found it necessary to do together, and what
piles upon piles of parcels, of all shapes and
sizes, they brought home at night, and stowed
away in that mysterious parlor which no
one else was allowed to enter. If Polly paid
for all those goods, I think she must have
made a requisition upon Dr. John’s newfound
pocket-book; for I am sure no little
girl’s purse could have been half long enough.</p>

<p>But at last there came a day, the 24th
of December it was, when Polly’s purchases
seemed to be all made. She did not go
down-town at all that day, but spent all the
morning closeted with Dr. John in the mysterious
room. And, altogether, that seemed
to be quite a mysterious day at Mrs. Grey’s;
for all day long there came such mysterious
noises from the mysterious parlor, and Mrs.
Grey and the housekeeper and Nurse Evans
went about with such mysterious smiles
upon their faces, that even Jenny and Jemmy
seemed to have a notion that something was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
the matter, and no amount of coaxing could
keep them in the nursery. Then, towards
evening, there came a mysterious ring at the
door, and a mysterious stranger was ushered
in, whose arrival seemed to fill Dr. Grey and
Mary with the most mysterious surprise and
delight; and finally the Doctor and Tom
took the carriage and went off upon some
mysterious errand.</p>

<p>If you could have peeped into the hospital
just about that time, you would have seen
that the mystery had penetrated even there;
for Berty sat, wrapped in cloaks, in a great
arm-chair, with a strangely excited expression
upon her thin, pale face. She had received
that morning a note, in a little white envelope,
addressed to Fräulein Bertha Weisser.
This note of course she could not read, but
Mrs. Gantz read it for her. It was an invitation,
in good set terms, to spend the evening
with Miss Mary Kendall, at her grandmother’s
house; and accompanying this note
was a new dress and other very comfortable
things for Berty to wear. And so our little
Berty sat there, very happy and eager, though
a little frightened and shy, waiting for the
carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>And when the carriage came, and Tom
took her up in his strong arms and bore her
down to it, a new surprise was waiting for
Berty; for there were her little ones all peeping
out to greet her with shouts of delight.
Berty thought this was all that was needed
to make her perfectly happy.</p>

<p>Miss Mary received them with a joyous
welcome, and kind Mrs. Grey had a sofa
ready furnished with pillows for Berty to
rest upon, which Dr. John insisted that she
should occupy at once, though she did not
feel in the least tired.</p>

<p>The children were very shy at first, but
Fritz and the twins soon made friends. Tim
took upon himself to entertain Gottlieb, and
as for Rosa and Lina, it was entertainment
enough for them to look about them. Berty
wondered at Tim; he seemed, she thought,
quite as much at home in Mrs. Grey’s handsome
house as at Biddy Flanagan’s, always
the same-merry, good-natured fellow, never
shy, and never too forward; she wondered,
too, at her little ones, so clean and bright and
wholesome; and when she heard Fritzy’s
happy laugh, she thought this was even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
better than the Christmas tree for which
she had longed.</p>

<p>Presently, little Mary, who had been flitting
in and out in a most extraordinary manner,
came in once more, and made a significant
motion to Dr. Grey, seeing which, the Doctor,
with a merry look, took her hand and led
her up in front of Berty’s couch.</p>

<p>“Berty,” said he, “you were wishing for
a fairy godmother, I hear. Mrs. Flanagan
was right about one thing, the fairies do not
emigrate; but she was wrong about the other,
for there is a tribe of them in America, wild
as it is; and as fast as you little people come
over they adopt you, because there are not
Yankee children enough to keep them busy.
So you see everybody has a fairy godmother,
and all is right. Hearing, from Mrs.
Flanagan, that you were in need of yours, I
have been at some pains to find her, and
here she is, very happy to make your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Berty was quite puzzled by this speech,
but Polly seemed to think it great fun; her
eyes fairly danced with glee as she dropped
Berty a queer little courtesy, and said, “Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Grey has summoned me, and I have come.
You were wishing for a Christmas tree, he
tells me. Ah, well; my children have but to
wish, and, presto! it is here!” saying which
she stamped with her little foot upon the
floor, and, lo! the folding-doors of the mysterious
parlor glided swiftly back and disclosed
a wondrous sight,—a Christmas tree
indeed, whose blazing tapers far outshone
those which had lighted Berty’s dreams,
whose graceful branches bent beneath their
weight of generous fruit! While the children’s
eyes were still dazzled with the burst
of light, Dr. Grey and Mary stepped forward
and took their stations on either side the
tree. Then Mary turned to the wondering
children, and pointing to it, said: “This,
children, is Berty’s Christmas Gift to her
little family.”</p>

<p>Berty was too happy, too thankful for
words; she could only cast a grateful look
at Dr. John, who, she felt sure, was at the
bottom of it somehow; and Dr. John looked
back at her with a merry twinkle in his eye,
which she did not quite understand. The
children, meanwhile, were pressing round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
tree, and devouring it with eager, wondering
eyes.</p>

<p>“It is finer than the Westermann’s, Lina,”
said Gottlieb, at last.</p>

<p>“But where is the Christ-child, Lieb?”
said little Rosa. “I don’t see him at all.”</p>

<p>“But he is here, Rosa,” said Dr. John.
“He is here, though you do not see him.
It is he who put it into the heart of Berty’s
fairy godmother here to give you this pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mary, who seemed somehow
to be in a great hurry, “if you have gazed
your fill, perhaps you would like me to gather
you some fruit;” and she took a long, hooked
stick which leaned against the wall beside
her, and began to take off the presents from
the tree.</p>

<p>I shall not trouble myself to describe those
presents. Christmas trees, I am happy to
say, are getting very common. A bountiful
crop of them springs up every year all over
the land, and I dare say there are none of
you who have not assisted in stripping at
least one. So I shall only tell you that every
one of the children got a very satisfactory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
share of the magical fruit,—every one except
Berty. Strange to say there seemed to
be no present for Berty. She never thought
of wishing for one; it was all just as she
had planned it herself, and she was heartily
satisfied; but so were not the others. Tim
especially, who had gotten a bountiful share
himself, was greatly concerned about Berty;
and at last, when the branches were nearly
bare, and nothing was yet forthcoming, he
bethought himself of speaking to Dr. Grey.
It might have been forgotten, though Tim
did not see how that could be. At any rate,
he knew Dr. John would never be content to
have Berty neglected, any more than he. So
he made his way through the children to
where the Doctor still stood beside the tree.</p>

<p>“Dr. Grey,” he whispered, “has Miss Mary
forgotten Berty, d’ye think—or what?”</p>

<p>“Berty!” cried the Doctor, speaking very
loud, and pretending to be quite astonished.
“Sure enough! the tree is quite stripped, and
Berty has nothing! That’s a great oversight
of yours, my good fairy; it will never do at
all. Couldn’t you manage to spirit us in a
present for Berty yet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“What shall it be?” asked Mary, paying
no attention to Berty’s exclamations and
assurances that the tree itself was present
enough for her.</p>

<p>“Since you have kept her waiting so long,”
said the Doctor, “I think it should be something
very nice,—something, for instance,
from over the sea.”</p>

<p>Mary nodded, and, tapping her stick three
times upon the floor, sang, in a queer little
piping voice, which made all the children
laugh,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs90">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come, fairies, good fairies, bring swiftly to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A present for Berty from over the sea!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then she stood quite still for a moment,
and looked towards the door, as if expecting
some one; and at last nodded and waved her
hand, and, dropping a courtesy to the Doctor,
said, “My good Doctor, your bidding is done.
You will find a present for Berty there at
your right hand. If my elves have been
somewhat dilatory, you must excuse them;
for the package, you perceive, was rather
heavy.”</p>

<p>The Doctor sprang quickly aside, and, sure
enough, there at his right hand, half hidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
by the spreading branches, was a heavy
oaken chest, strongly bound with iron, which
everybody stared at as if it had fallen from
the sky.</p>

<p>“Upon me word, Miss Mary,” said Tim,
“if ye’d hire out yer elves down at the docks
there, ye’d make yer fortin in no time.
They’re stronger than any derrick they have
there, certain sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tim,” answered Polly, laughing,
“I’ll think of it.”</p>

<p>“Somebody’ll have to open it for Bert,”
said prudent Gottlieb, looking appealingly to
Dr. John; “she never can.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough. Shall we want a hammer,
think you, or is it locked?” said Dr. Grey,
bending over the chest with a puzzled look.
“Ah, yes, here’s a lock,” he added, fumbling
at the side towards the wall. “Have your
elves brought the key, Madam Fairy?”</p>

<p>Polly fumbled in her pocket a little, and
brought out a huge bunch of keys, one of
which Dr. John, with great jingling, applied
to the lock. Tim had a shrewd suspicion
that the chest was not locked at all, nor even
fairly closed; but, before he had time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
assure himself by nearer inspection, the cover
flew up with a bang, and out sprang—what?
A genie? All the children thought so at
first, and shrank away, while Berty covered
her eyes with her hands.</p>

<p>But the strange being, whatever it was,
went straight to Berty’s couch, and bending
down, whispered some German words close
in her ear. Berty could not help peeping out
between her fingers. Surely, it was no genie.
Would a genie call her his darling, his goddaughter,
his dear, dear child? Would a
genie look at her with blue eyes so like her
mother’s? Ah no, this was no genie, though
he had come to her as strangely as any genie
could. It was, it <em>could</em> be, no one in the
world but the dear, dear uncle Gottlieb, from
the blessed old Fatherland.</p>

<p>So Berty let the stranger take her in his
arms, and gave him kiss for kiss, and answered
his caresses with her own, and called
the children to her, one by one, to show this
dear uncle who had come so far to see them
all. It was so sweet to little Berty to feel
that strong arm round her, and to know that
it was ready to shield her from all care and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
harm; it was so sweet to hear him call her
children his, and to know that he would care
for them as she, with all her efforts, never
could have done.</p>

<p>Yes, it was uncle Gottlieb, to whom Dr.
Grey had written as soon as he heard of him
from Berty, and who, hearing thus, for the
first time, of his sister’s death, (for Madame
Hansmann’s letter had miscarried,) had hastened
to the orphans, and arrived just in time
to be put into Polly’s strong box. He had
entered heartily into the joke, though he declared
that he had nearly smothered in carrying
it out; and Dr. John averred that he had
chuckled so much as nearly to discover himself
to the children before the time. Polly
produced from the chest a whole bundle of
presents for Berty, which she had hidden
there the better to carry out her scheme;
but, though Berty was properly grateful, it
was easy to see that uncle Gottlieb’s niece
thought him the best present of all. There
is no need that I should tell you they spent
a merry evening,—what could prevent them?
Uncle Gottlieb informed them next morning,
for they all spent the night with hospitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Mrs. Grey, that he had risen in the world,—become
a composer of music and leader of
the band; and also that some old relative in
Frankfort had left him a little house. He
had been thinking, he said, of getting a wife
to keep house for him; but he should take
the children all back with him, and Berty
should keep house: it would be much better,
and leave him more time for his music.</p>

<p>And so Berty and her little ones went
back to the dear Fatherland. It was hard
parting from the Doctor and Mary and Tim;
but Dr. Grey promised to bring Mary to see
them at Frankfort, which promise he has
kept. And as for Tim, I have a shrewd suspicion
that that young gentleman has by this
time paid uncle Gottlieb off in his own coin,
and taken Berty another sea-voyage; but
then Lina must be quite big enough for a
housekeeper now.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
